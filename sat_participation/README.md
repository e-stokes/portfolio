# Overview
To aggregate SAT and ACT scores and participation rates from each state in the United States. We'll seek to identify trends in the data and combine our data analysis with outside research to identify likely factors influencing participation rates and scores in various states.


# Problem:
> The new format for the SAT was released in March 2016. As an employee of the College Board - the organization that administers the SAT - you are a part of a team that tracks statewide participation and recommends where money is best spent to improve SAT participation rates. Your presentation and report should be geared toward **non-technical** executives with the College Board and you will use the provided data and outside research to make recommendations about how the College Board might work to increase the participation rate in a **state of your choice**.

# Conclusion:

Based on my observations, the state of Wisconsin would be a good start-up state. With it's high average score of 1294, and low participation rate, starting a campaign to sweep the ACT requirement from the state would be capable given a strong marketing campagin coupled with an adjustment in the testing structure and curriculum. Spending money to adjust the package of the SAT to be a complete testing package instead of having to pay for each section and then marketing our newly packaged test with a more meaningful curriculum and drive to show participants that the test has value for their future beyond just college acceptance. Marketing with flyers, T.V adervtisements, State, and University support drive students to partake in the SAT alone. To become the standard, we must be the standard with the SAT leading and innovating the future of testing.
