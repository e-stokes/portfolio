1,Discussing the SCF  can t seem to get past the team partisanship  I m a Bruins fan  full disclosure  so I thought I d post thoughts about levels of  dirty  play in hockey  and see what others thought   Source  Am former goalie through HS  a close family member is AHL player  I ve been watching NHL since the early    s   As always YMMV   I think there are definite levels of hockey play   CLEAN hockey   No need for detail here   Looks a lot like Olympic hockey  checking and stickwork is light and mostly polite   PHYSICAL hockey   Lots of checking  no careless stickwork  no blindside hits  no post whistle shots   CHIPPY hockey   Physical hockey but lots of extra finish on checks  less than pious stickwork  post whistle wrassling and pawing   DIRTY hockey   Say  stomping on a guy s stick blade during the faceoff   Or  say  whacking a guy s exposed wrist with your stick during the faceoff   Punching a guy while he s down in a front of the net tangle    Trying to show I m not at all partisan here  those who have been watching know what I m referring to    HEADHUNTING   Boarding a guy face first   High elbows at full speed   Knee on knee   Etc   IMHO I can  to an extent   accept  all of those except the head hunting   That s what penalties are for  etc   And the classic  enforcer  is usually a combo of dirty and chippy   meting out a weird flavor of frontier justice that tends to normalize over time   Most importantly  there are a LOT of players who engage in these types of hockey over time   You don t label a player for one event  you do it for a pattern   So  even though most Bruins fans would label Nazr Kadry a headhunter  I don t at all   I think he s a CHIPPY DIRTY player who had a bad night in Round     Similarly  I don t look at the Blues roster and think  those are all headhunters      OTOH  the pattern has been weirdly consistent and specific this series  so one wonders   Anyhow  those are my thoughts on the differentiation between types of play and possible labels   Love to hear what others think ,What s  dirty    Serious ,nhl

9,Im an oilers fan and we need a bit of everything  But having McDavid already  getting   more super star would solve alot of problems  KUCHEROV imo would do just that  Also im assuming were going to sign filppula as rumored  Hes from final finland so there hoping he could rejuvenate his country men in puljuarvvi    Gagner Mcdavid kucherov  Nuge draisaitl chiasson  Nygard filppula puljuarvvi Lucic cave kassian Khaira   Klefbom larsson  Nurse Russell  Sekera benning  Jones   Koskinen Starrett FA  As good as this team looks  I see us as a playoff team and nothing else  Maybe im wrong  Maybe we would win the cup with this exact team  but theres some teams out there like the sharks who have   lines that can score  Blues Bruins vegas caps leafs blue jackets lightning same thing also  Got   solid lines that can score any given night  This is exactly what the oilers lineup would look like minus the lines switched around maybe with     guys only  Other then that would be nice wouldnt it    Whose your guy that you would take for your team and why  Also would that guy make your team a stanley cup contender ,HARDCORE NHL FANS  If you can add any player you want to your current team  who would you want and why ,nhl

286,BOSTON    Laila Anderson is only    years old  but she swears she has a gift  She can always predict who is going to score the first goal for her beloved St  Louis Blues   Before Game   of the Stanley Cup Final on Wednesday  Anderson told her mother it was going to be Ryan O Reilly   ADVERTISEMENT   My mom was like   It s not going to happen    Laila said  That got her extra fired up    I said   There s two things you just said wrong    she recalled   First  you don t doubt ROR  And you don t doubt me     Mom   she said standing on the ice at TD Garden grinning after the Blues won their first Stanley Cup and O Reilly    after scoring the game s opening goal    won the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP   I called it    EDITOR S PICKS  Blues  O Reilly scores again  wins Conn Smythe  Blues lean on  cool customer  Binnington in G  win Laila  who is battling a life threatening autoimmune disease  isn t just a Blues super fan  she s the team s good luck charm  So much so that the Blues flew her and her mother to Boston for Game    and then invited them on the ice to celebrate with the team   Defenseman  lt a href    Parayko lt  a gt   after hoisting the Cup himself  knelt onto the ice to meet Laila  She wiped away tears  and then held on and kissed the trophy  Pat Maroon  a St  Louis native  lit up when he saw Laila in the crowd   Laila   he shouted   We did it  princess   Then the two posed for a photo   Anderson has hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis  HLH   a disease only    other children in the world have been diagnosed with  Her love of the Blues  she said  was one of the things that helped her through treatments and recovery  Many Blues players got to know Laila through team sponsored visits at the hospital  and she formed an especially strong connection with Parayko and Alex Steen    We get to show up to the rink and be with the guys  do things like that  But you go to the hospital  and you speak with her  and you watch her go through all that stuff  I can t imagine what she s going through  What kinds of things they re putting in her body to try and help her recover   Parayko told ESPN before the Stanley Cup Final began   She continues to have a strong attitude  A positive attitude  It s so special  We might lose a hockey game  and we re frustrated or go home really upset  But there are people out there trying to battle for their lives    Laila s condition has limited her travel significantly  She had a bone marrow transplant in January that meant she could only go between the hospital and her house   Then  before Game   of the Western Conference finals  Laila s doctors cleared her to attend  Anderson s mom  Heather  broke the news in a video  which went viral  Laila then attended Games   and    and returned to the Enterprise Center when the Blues reached the Stanley Cup Final   Then before Game    Heather Anderson met with her daughter again and pressed record on her phone    If you could watch the game  anywhere in the world tomorrow    anywhere in the world    where would you watch your boys play tomorrow   her mom asked    Boston   Laila said  without pause    What if I told you the Blues called  and they want you at the game   her mom asked   play      Blues superfan Laila celebrates Cup win with Parayko   year old Blues fan Laila Anderson hugs Colton Parayko on the ice after St  Lous wins the Stanley Cup  Laila looked at her mom   What  How     The doctor said it s OK   her mom said   Then Laila could barely contain her tears    No he didn t  Mommy  no he didn t   she said breaking down  collapsing into her mom s shoulder    That video last night her mom posted was truly amazing   Maroon said Wednesday morning   She s been an inspiration to all of us throughout the year and Alex Steen has done a good job of bringing her and making her feel comfortable  Colton Parayko the same way  making her feel welcome to the team and the St  Louis Blues welcome her and her family  It s been truly amazing  She s a fighter and she s going to continue to fight  She s our inspiration  We look up to her  what she has to go through every single day  To get on that plane  I know the doctors are questionable of getting her out there because of her health and to say that she gets to come on the plane and travel out here to see us play  that s truly amazing  I m so happy for her     When asked if Laila gave the team any pointers  Maroon said   She gives us enough  just the way she fights  Go out there and fight for her  What she has to go through every single day    On the ice  Laila    wearing a jean jacket and a Blues championship cap    was as popular as any St  Louis player  She did several media scrums  Her mom stood beside her the entire time    Being here for this  it s everything I imagined and more   Laila said   I don t even know what to say  I love this team  I love them so much  ,Superfan Anderson      part of Blues  celebration,nhl

330,The last two years  it seems to be grit and defense  I know the Caps scored a lot and had that lethal power play  but you have to consider the fact that a lot of their   on   goals came from grit and playing that  playoff  style  The Blues were even more of that  Obviously you have to have your skill guys  ie Tarasenko  Ovi  O Reily  but then you have those depth guys who contribute at key moments  ie DSP and Pat Maroon  I can go back to the Hawks run in       Hawks fan here  and remember each game of the final  different players shined  It wasn t their stars but their depth  So  what  in your opinion  makes a Stanley Cup Winning team ,What makes a Stanley Cup team ,nhl

474,I m a diehard Oilers fan  Yesterday on a dating app a guy was chirping me saying Edm is the worst NHL franchise  I am well aware that my team has been garage the last decade  but then he stated hes a Sabres fan       I obviously had to chirp back and say our teams are equally as bad  and that Buffalo has probably been worse the last ten years  I then decided to back up my theory       Below is best to worst NHL teams based on regular season points the past ten years    Unfortunately for me  I was wrong  Buffalo wasn t totally awful         this ended up being the difference to put them ahead of EDM     ,NHL team rankings  by points  last ten years,nhl
478,In my opinion  that s a fair contract for Kevin Hayes right now  and   years from now when the cap goes higher  it will be a steal  He is maybe the only     forward in the entire NHL besides Laine who can skate and play well enough to keep up with the modern NHL  He s not super fast but he s not slow  Above average speed  great size  high skill level  great vision  His long reach eats up many passing lanes defensively  I d be interested for more in depth advanced stats info  but his corsi relative has been way in the positive for three years in a row  I think he produced at a     point pace per    games his past two seasons  making him an excellent  nd line center at worst   He s not flashy  but there s something Mark Stone and Ryan O Reillyish about his game  He might not hit as much as them but he knows how to use his body to protect the puck and make plays and that s more important   I always thought Hayes might be one of the best values in free agency in terms of his age  being in his prime  and the fact he was undervalued and would get signed for   per year instead of   to     Well    is a little closer to being too high  but I think  as I said in the title  that s fair value right now  and will be great value in the future  He also brings much needed size to the Flyers forward group  Giroux and TK are skilled  but lack size  Voracek has some size but nothing like Hayes  Couterier has a bit of size but nothing like Hayes and I don t think he s as fast as Hayes either   If Giroux plays wing  Hayes is the Flyers clear    center  If Giroux plays center  Hayes can be a dominant  C and get PP time  In any case  he is an excellent player  one of the most underrated players in the NHL  and the Flyers are getting him in his prime on a fair contract for no assets in return  Huge win for the Flyers ,Kevin Hayes signs   year    million deal with the Flyers  I play devil s advocate on the criticism for free ,nhl

18, LA Kings fan  btw   This soggy salad has made so many enemies by being a terrible sportsman and human being that  although I don t wish this on him  a crazed fan of one of the other NHL teams is going to fucking murder this jackass  If the refs called it fairly then it wouldn t be that much of an issue  But the fact that he gets away with so much bullshit is not going to bode well for this guy s well being on the planet  The vigilantes will make this guy pay and it won t be proportional to his crimes  but no one will be surprised  The NHL has to keep all players accountable and when they don t my money is on a lunatic fucking this guy up ,Marchand,nhl

90,This fuckin team  that is all ,San Jose will have the biggest asterisk next to their stanley cup championship if they win ,nhl
91,This is the third blown game changing call given to the sharks this postseason  Unbelievable ,The officiating in this years playoffs is truly an embarrassment to this sport ,nhl
92,That was bullshit  That was a bullshit call   We didn t deserve that goal  I m legit fucking annoyed,As a sharks fan   ,nhl
93,San Jose seems to be really lucky in terms of calls  First Vegas now clear handpass for the OT winner in St Louis  I don t care if it s none reviewable rules need to be changed adjusted  It s getting out of hand ,Are games being decided by poor officiating ,nhl
94,How is that a goal  It s very easy to see that Meier hits it with his glove over to his team mate    What was the reason for not calling this a hand pass  Are they saying it hit his wrist or something   I m a bruins fan so I m not salty or anything just wondering  That seemed so blatant ,Ok I m confused,nhl
95,Sharks with another BS call  There ll be an asterisk next to their name if they finally get the cup ,What a crock,nhl

100,Dallas Stars fan here with no love for STL but this is beyond ridiculous    amp  x   B   Rule      Handling Puck         Handling Puck      A player shall be permitted to stop or  bat  a puck in the air with his open hand  or push it along the ice with his hand  and the play shall not be stopped   unless  in the opinion of the Referee  he has deliberately directed the puck to a teammate in any zone        Rule      Hand Pass          Hand Pass      A player shall be permitted to stop or  bat  a puck in the air with his open hand  or push it along the ice with his hand  and the play shall not be stopped   unless  in the opinion of the on ice officials  he has directed the puck to a teammate  or has allowed his team to gain an advantage  and subsequently possession and control of the puck is obtained by a player of the offending team    either directly or deflected off any player or official ,Worst post season officiating ever,nhl
101,That was a hand pass  yet you re gonna slap binningtons ass and basically say  you have next game   Fuck you refs  Fuck you NHL  I now despise you as much as the nfl ,Absolute bullshit call,nhl
103,Obviously think it was a hand pass  However none of the refs so it can t be reviewed  Also  there is a possibility it was off the pants and      delay of game non call led ur goal so we can call it even  Still think refs screwed it up big time,Sharks fan,nhl
108,,Only   people in the arena didn t see that hand pass ,nhl
112,,As a Golden Knight fan I m really loving how SJ has won multiple games now cause of bad calls,nhl
116,First off  as a diehard Blues fan I m in shock right now  I do want to legitimately ask  can someone explain to me why this was  unreviewable   What determines reviewable plays  Especially if it directly leads to a goal  I thought the refs were reviewing it after the play and can t Toronto review all plays anyway  Finally  is there a good counter point to why not all plays should be reviewable  Legitimate question  not a trick to start a fight  Thanks guys  and keep it relatively civil lol    Let s go Blues ,Question about the Sharks vs  Blues outcome tonight and NHL rules ,nhl
120,When I look at a replay that is slow mow all the way through  it seems to clearly change direction after hitting his shin  Just trying to figure out if anyone else sees that or if I have teal tinted glasses ,Is anyone else seeing the puck bounce off of    s leg before getting to Nyquist ,nhl
121,At this point with all the calls going the sharks way no other fan or team will apriciate them and will call thire victory cheap amd not earned ,If sharks win the cup,nhl
122,,That no call on the hand pass was as egregious as the no call on pass interference in the rams vs saints game  So pissed right now as a Blues fan ,nhl
124,,Even Sharks fans are starting to feel bad ,nhl
126,Both teams played hard and well  Mistakes were made on both ends  Bad calls were made   Perron throwing puck out of play which  should have been a penalty for delay of game  He continues to get two goals  No call on this undoubtedly changed the game   Hand pass call missed and ends the game  In a perfectly called game  the hand pass stops the play and who knows how the game would have gone from there    There s plenty of pressure for officials to make calls perfectly all game   and quite frankly  losing that way stings  but it shouldn t take away from the way either team played    Congrats to Jumbo for finding his groove tonight and putting up some goals    Also glad to see tarasenko get back into the scoring and see Perron get a couple goals    Bad calls went both ways  and they probably always will unless video review rules are changed  It is what it is though  and despite losing  both teams deserve credit for the way they played    Great series so far  and if you guys come out on top  I ll be a bandwagon fan for you guys without doubt to get the cup     Props to both teams for giving us what looks like it will be a heart attack waiting to happen for each and every one of us ,Blues fan honest take on game    a hard played game on both ends of the ice  Both teams deserve credit for playing hard playoff hockey ,nhl
130,What a joke,So  we are just playing Calvinball at this point ,nhl
134,,Just chiming in on the hand pass as an ass fan rooting for the Sharks  This is a very ugly day for the league  I trust the officials when they indicated they didn t see it  I understand it s not reviewable but damn that s rough  Hand passes should ve been reviewable when offsides became reviewable ,nhl
136,Is there anyone here that can think of some teams that this would have been over turned for  , this call cant be reviewed ,nhl
140,     Hand Pass   A player shall be permitted to stop or  bat  a puck in the air with his open hand  or push it along the ice with his hand  and the play shall not be stopped unless  in the opinion of the on ice officials  he has directed the puck to a teammate  or has allowed his team to gain an advantage  and subsequently possession and control of the puck is obtained by a player of the offending team  either directly or deflected off any player or official ,To those saying it may have hit Jay Bouwmeester s leg,nhl
141,I know hand passes are not reviewable with video  Neither are crosschecking penalties  Yet in game   vs Vegas  Pavelski won a faceoff  got pushed in the chest  and flopped his head back like as a Ducks fan I ve seen him do hundreds of times before especially in the playoffs to try to draw a penalty  right as another Vegas player was skating behind him  and this caused him to lose his balance and fall on his head  No ref had a penalty call during the run of play  but after the whistle was blown  they huddled with the linesman  and the linesman said he saw a stick hit Pavelski in the face  something that was completely made up  specifically it seems  we can now say with       hindsight  to try to the Sharks go deep in the playoffs  so why wasn t the same done in this instance   It also calls into question  if it s illegal to get information from Toronto  from video review  to overturn a call  but it s legal to get information from the linesman to overturn a call  why is that sometimes the refs go to the linesman first  but sometimes they go to the video review first  It would seem that when they want a call overturned  they can choose to go to the linesman first  and say  we overturned it legally   but when they want the call to stand  they can go straight to the video judge  hear the truth of what happened from him first  so then they can say   yeah it was a handpass  but I got that info from the video review first  not from the linesman  so I can t overturn it    Seems like another loophole that can be used to fix hockey games  which in my opinion  seems to be the    goal of the NHL this postseason ,When Pavelski got injured vs Vegas on his flop gone wrong  no ref called a penalty  but they huddled  amp  the linesman made one up  Why couldn t they do the same with the handpass ,nhl
144,At this point  they re deciding as many games as the players ,Petition to have the officials  names inscribed on the Stanley Cup,nhl
146,Well then NHL  get your shit together  Get it all together  And put it in a backpack  All your shit  So it s together  And if you gotta take it somewhere  take it somewhere  you know  take it to the shit store and sell it  Or put it in a shit museum  I don t care what you do  you just gotta get it  Get your shit together    Seriously the NHL looks like a fucking joke right now ,So the Avs have a goal in game   called back due to an incredibly questionable offsides call with no clear      evidence of offsides  but a blatant      hand pass on a goal is allowed ,nhl
147,Yes it was a hand pass  you think the Sharks organization or fanbase cares  They ll take it any day of the week  Don t blame them for the bullshit judgement of the refs   Y all know better  hockey is a very fast paced game  and believe it or not  even   officials on the ice can miss a call  And more importantly  sometimes you benefit from blown calls  and sometimes you don t  Quid pro quo  it s a part of the game   Blues had the win in the  rd period but allowed a game tying goal  They shouldn t have let it go to OT  Refs call a generous   minute major instead of the usual   minute minor  No big deal  but they didn t exactly hand over those   goals that Vegas allowed  Even for a   minute major  that s a lot of goals to give up in   short handed minutes  You can t NOT blame Vegas for that  You want the Sharks to get an asterisk by their name if they win the cup  Y all are salty as fuck    Make no mistake  I m a Bruins fan  and I know we ll destroy the winner of the Sharks Blues series  But I wish the Eastern Final has been as entertaining to watch as the last few Sharks rounds    s out saying that the NHL and the officials have come together in a secret room to decide to start making calls to favor the Sharks makes us seem like a bunch of fucktwat      conspiracy theorists ,Y all are some salty motherfuckers,nhl
148,This on the heels of two New York teams  and Chicago  jumping lots of small market teams to move to the top   in the NHL draft lottery   Before that  I think Edmonton needed a new stadium  but the organization was floundering for almost an entire decade  and then they get Mcdavid   Leafs were floundering for years  they get Austin Matthews   When s the last time a small market team jumped to the    overall pick  Or got lots of calls to go their way to win even one playoff series  let alone   going on   like the Sharks now   And just look how the Sharks were built  Boston basically gives them Joe Thornton without apparently even offering him to the rest of the league  Brent Burns traded to them for pennies on the dollar  Erik Karlsson traded to them for  yet again  not a single premier asset back  And many of these GMs who make supposedly  stupid  trades get hired back to run another team a few years later  like a revolving door  Almost like there are too many players to control and keep quiet  so the  fixing  is done at the GM level  and the referee level  where only a few dozen people have to keep their mouths shut  not thousands of players   Hate to think this way  since it ruins pro sports and I like watching pro sports  but it s getting very hard not to when you watch what repeatedly happens  I m even an LA Rams fan but everyone saw the non call that was made to ensure a Boston vs LA Superbowl instead of Boston vs New Orleans  How convenient   ,Is it strange to anyone else how the finals in every major US sports league always seems to be Boston or a NY team vs a California team  much of the time ,nhl
150,You blame the refs    million and Schwartz cant even score on the empty net      suuuuck,Jaden and his Blues,nhl
151,Game   in STL didn t end on a hand pass assist for the game winning goal   however I do find it odd that this play  is a non reviewable play   What is going to keep players from here on out from passing the puck to their mates in front of the net from their hand  If they score it s a good goal even tho it s from a hand pass    Looks like a rule change to goal reviews will be coming ,Not a hand pass,nhl
152,STFU ABOUT THE REFS  We all get it  It s been atrocious this year  But all your whining and crying and belly aching isn t gonna change the outcome of an already finished game  Nor is it gonna fix the officiating  It s getting so redundant that I m on the verge of unfollowing every page associated with the only league I actually enjoy in professional sports  So don t bother telling me to unfollow and or not pay attention because I m already thinking about it lmao  Just watch the game and stop trying to be arm chair refs  It s not gonna change anything ,Not sure how people will react to this but   ,nhl
157,Just checking to see if the Stanley Cup Final has a set date to start  Guys on the radio in Boston say Memorial Day  Is this true or does the start date depend on when both series finish ,Stanley Cup Final,nhl
159,Even if they didn t see the hand pass live  which watching I find almost impossible to believe considering it WAS the play  would anyone at all blame them for getting the call right even if it s not reviewable  Seems like an odd  integrity  flex but ok ,Why not just pretend you saw it ,nhl
160,We need better refs with more accountability  not a series of rule changes to make everyone feel better in the short term  it won t work ,Hockey  where we review every play  will suck ,nhl
164,  million and he can t hit an open goal with empty net  Really   This is playoffs   He s the only reason the sad Blues lost the game  You gotta bring it  Nut up or Shut up ,Jaden lost game for Blues,nhl
165,I have seen many many people saying how did none of the   refs see the hand pass  They must have not been watching  If you honestly believe that check this link  sight lines      would ve posted the pic but I can t post         You can clearly see that none of the   high officials would ve seen it due to the guys body being between them and the puck when he hand passed   The low official due to his positioning was looking through the net and the goalie  There is no way any of the   high officials would ve made that call due to an obstructed view because if they were wrong when the play seemed to be right in front of the low guy and he didn t call it  they d be burned alive    This based on sight lines was probably only the low officials call  And he blocked himself out on positioning  The cameras had better angles so obviously we can watch and see it but I don t think anyone with the refs view could ve seen it and comfortably made that call  It s unfortunate that it cost the Blues in such a big moment but if anything blame positioning not the refs not watching the play or being corrupt ,The only issue with yesterday s no call is maybe the low officials positioning ,nhl
167,Every scoring play is reviewed by the booth  takes like    seconds   If something don t look right buzz down and get the referees to take a closer look   Done  ,CFL doing it right   ,nhl
169,Let s not forget the delay of game Perron committed that wasn t called  the slash on Haley that wasn t called  or the blatant hit to the head against Braun that wasn t called  So before you scream hand pass why don t you go back and watch those highlights first ,Blues got lucky in Game  ,nhl
181,The refs can t rule something they didn t see  that s what everyone wanted after the vegas series right  My best advice for St Louis  Get over it    bad calls happen all the time  and it s been especially prevalent in the playoffs this year  It s an unfortunate call yes  but it s not the first time something like this has happened this year  It s not about what happens  it s about how you respond  If the blues can come back tomorrow night and win a game in their building they are back in it  Whining and crying isn t gonna make them overturn the goal  So my best advice is suck it up and instead of bitching and moaning about what happened last night  focus on the next task at hand which is game    I know this will get downvoted but it s the truth  Nobody s ever won anything by complaining about what happened in the past ,Input on the controversial goal,nhl

187,I was playing D in the conference finals  and we were in overtime  Time for my shift   I m going to do everthing in my power to make sure this isn t the shift that loses us the game  The puck came to the winger beside me  just outside the crease   I tied up his stick  To my horror  he simply used his hand to bat the puck over to the open winger  and not two seconds later it was in the back of the net  Game over  My goalie was furious  but his protest fell on deaf ears  I was stunned  I couldn t even move  I didn t know what to think  The refs wouldn t even review it   It was bedlam in the stands as beer cups and garbage rained down    shudders     amp  x   B   Thank god this is reality  and something like that would never happen   That was traumatic ,I had a nightmare last night  ,nhl

190,,How many teams who have touched the conference trophy have gone on to win the cup ,nhl
191,Yes  the refs blew the call  Yes  it sucks  bc it seems so obvious  and the stakes so high  But replay sucks and creates about as many problems as it solves   In all sports   It s true that review does solve some issues just about perfectly  Did the goal cross the line  Works  But rarely is it that tidy    Start with ridiculous offside review  Don t even need to elaborate   Then there s goaltender interference  Like that s EVER going to be definitive  And how about those   minute delays  And challenges to the challenges   IMHO suckiest part is that the presence of replay creates an unfair expectation that everything will end up perfect  Of course it won t  Refs miss lots of calls in every game  Mind you  not as big as this obvious hand pass  but you get the drift   Downvote away  ,Unpopular opinion  ban instant replay,nhl

231,As a Sharks fan in his late    s  I ve basically dealt with watching my favorite team choke for as long as I ve been alive  Plenty of years at the top of the conference  plenty of years being the favorite  even choking after winning the presidents cup years ago   They ve always been on the wrong side of history  Sorry Vancouver  you definitely have had it worse    I ve hoped and prayed for breaks and lucky bounces over all these years  but now  having been on the right side of so many controversial plays  it feels a little icky  I m happy that my team is having success  and they still aren t even close to reaching the promise land    I m curious to reach out to you fans  and ask you to recall times in which your team was on the right side of a bad call  s  and reminisce on the time and how it impacted the way you felt  Ultimately I m a fan  I m going to root for my team  It s not the players fault that these refs have made these calls  but obviously as players  they all play a part in the process    Thoughts  Thanks everyone ,Sharks Fan with a question for all fans,nhl

279,NBC announcers constantly saying that the sharks are in shock and in shambles  this game definitely had been disappointing for the sharks and not exactly a confidence boost  but literally in the first round the sharks lost game   at home to vegas      it s blatant disrespect and lack of awareness by the announcers to act like this team hasn t been in the situation before and isn t one of the most experienced teams in the nhl ,Sharks are in shambles,nhl

299,So I had a thought come to me earlier and I was wondering if the NHL has any protocol to follow if it happens  What if  at the start of the game  a team were to accidentally put the puck in their own net without a player from the other team touching it at all  Usually the goal is awarded to the last player on the other team to touch it  but in a circumstance like this where nobody on the other team would have had an opportunity to come in contact with it  who would receive credit for the goal and how would it be marked down on a scoresheet  Thanks in advance ,Own Goals Not Touched by Opposition,nhl
300,You ve all seen the clip  Game    Sharks pull a hand pass to get the game winning goal  hand pass wasn t called or even reviewed  Now I see lots of people arguing that it wasn t directed at a player  I am here to disprove that with nothing more than human anatomy   The NHL clearly states that batting the puck with your hand is fine  as long as it is batted onto the ice  The only time a hand pass is legal is in a team s defensive zone  Just in case you also didn t know  closing your fingers on a puck is illegal in all circumstances unless you are a goalie  Now that we ve established the rulebook s definition of a hand pass  let s get to anatomy   On the play  Meier swats the puck out of the air while on the ground in an attempt to prevent a Blues  possession  Or did he  Do something for me very quickly  Let your arms rest at your side  Then bring them forward the way Meier did  Notice something  Your palms always face inward unless you make an effort to have them face a different direction  That s where we see the issue with the play   Look at Meier s palm during the hand pass  It s not facing inward  it s facing parallel to his arms  straight forward  This means there had to have been a reason as to why he would change the position of his hand  That reason is most likely him going for a hand pass  The reason he faced his palm directly in front of him was that Karlsson was also directly in front of him  If he moved his hand to face Karlsson  the puck would begin to move towards Karlsson  And that s exactly what happened   After Meier bats the puck  Nyquist intercepts the pass and passes it to Karlsson  Karlsson goes on to win the game  there s no review of the goal  and San Jose gets their  rd questionable victory in   playoff series   Now here s the question everyone asked  Should it have been counted  My answer  no  I do have a bit of bias as a Blues fan  but since my bias is backed up by human anatomy  I d say I m more likely to be right than wrong in this situation  While some may argue it isn t allowed to be reviewed  I d say that rule is pretty unclear as it stands  Not only was an offsides reviewed to give San Jose a division series win while a hand pass to give them a     lead wasn t  but the rule s don t state the exact circumstances that could allow for a review on a game winning goal  Not to mention this is the playoffs and that if San Jose wins this series because of that call  it would be very suspicious given their other two series they had handed to them   So  in conclusion  the goal never should have been counted  Human anatomy proves Meier did  in fact  direct the puck to Karlsson  Also  San Jose s questionable playoff run doesn t help their case about this call  My Blues bias could be a big part of this  but at the same time  I don t research these kinds of things with bias in mind  If I did  my results would be far less conclusive than they are  I simply wanted to know if we got screwed over by the refs of if we deserved the loss  and I found we got screwed over   If anyone else has looked into this or thinks my evidence is faulty  feel free to argue your own point in the replies  I love debate and hockey so it could be pretty fun  Like the old gumshoes shows ,Ending the Sharks vs  Blues Hand Pass Debate Once And For All    With Science ,nhl

340,Game     Sharks vs Golden Knights  VGK are winning     in the  rd period    Eakin catches Pavelski with a high stick and he s get a  min game misconduct for something that should have been a  minute minor as most since blood was drawn    This leads to the sharks scoring   almost instantly and they win the series in OT    Fast forward to another Game    Sharks vs Avalanche   MacKinnon scores a game tying goal  what could be a huge swing for the Avalanche   Sharks for whatever reason decide to call for a review to see if the Avalanche were offside   There wasn t an ounce of conclusive proof to overturn the call  no angle showed any bit of conclusive proof Landeskog was offside   But nonetheless  without any conclusive proof they still go ahead and overturn the call      Not even two minutes later  MacKinnon was blatantly tripped on a breakaway and it was ignored  If anything was deserving of a penalty shot that definitely was    The Avalanche were effectively screwed out of a game typing goal and penalty shot in the most important game in the series    Now to last night   Game    Sharks vs Blues  A must win game for the Sharks and a clinching game for the Blues    Let me first say that overtime goals being non reviewable is irresponsible and borderline ignorant by the NHL    A perfect example of why that rule is wrong on so many levels is last night  another very blatant illegal play by another Sharks player    The referees saying that they  didn t see  the hand pass is just ridiculous    In an instant the Blues had that chance to move was just ripped away from them from irresponsible jobs on the referees part     I don t know if the Sharks are just the luckiest team in the NHL or what but at every turn  crucial calls are always in their favor    It ll be interesting to see if the Sharks do move on how they fair against the Bruins   The team that constantly gets away with cheating vs the team that s as dirty as can be ,Are the Sharks just  lucky  or what ,nhl

416,This has nothing to do about the referees  the on ice product  or really anything to do with their presentation  What the NHL truly does not care about  is their representation in gaming form  Yes  I m ranting about EA sports NHL series   Gone are the days of enjoying gm mode  the overly complicated scouting system that looks simple enough  yet is so mind numbingly bad  most players change settings back to what  worked    years ago  Is there a franchise level prospect in the ohl  Better tell your scouts to look at him personally because they are absolutely remedial at their jobs   Want to play as an actual up and coming youngster with aspirations to be a top NHL player  You re in luck  only if you want to play in the chl  despite having multiple European leagues and teams in the game   Did you just finish your entry level contract and win the Stanley cup  conn Smythe  art Ross  and rocket Richard trophies multiple times  Be prepared to be offered      contracts for around     million per season for   years   What about the actual gameplay though  Well you re in luck playing tripping simulator       If the puck is   inches left of your stick  press the poke check to watch your player jab his stick directly at your opponents skates  because that s defense  Hitting is a breeze too  and by that I mean you can set up a Kronwall type hit and watch as your opponent blows by you as if you were just a slight breeze in his way  Stick lifts are great as well  if you want to teach developers how to completely fuck up collision detection as your stick goes directly through your opponent s stick   Don t have enough friends or club mates online to form a full team  That s alright the expansive artificial intelligence can give you a player that has Wayne Gretzky s offensive skills with nick Lidstrom s defense or simple jack that can t even figure out how to skate towards a loose puck when they are clearly the closest player to it  There is no in between   Yes  all these problems are made by EA sports and their unwillingness to fix issues that have plagued their games for years  over multiple console generations  The bigger issue is the NHL allows this company to use their image  brand  and license and they put little to no effort in putting forth a decent product  The NHL is allowing EA sports to release a product that would be laughably bad  if they didn t release it yearly  at the same price as a game like red dead redemption  halo  or assassin s creed    It feels like a slap in the face of hockey fans that once enjoyed playing these games and shows the NHL does not care about how a company harms their image  as long as they get a nice check   I would love to see the NHL drop EA and hire their own team of developers to make a game they can control the quality of  I just doubt Bettman cares enough about technology to make that happen  based on how awful the NHL app is on multiple platforms  ,Proof that the NHL does not care about their image,nhl

206,Just to get the numbers out if the way    Out of     times in history a team has been up     in the series  only   times has a team ever come back and won  That equals      of the time  or roughly   in      So that means Columbus has over a     chance of moving on  mathematically      Anyways     I m impartial on both teams here  I give Tampa credit for their season  and Columbus has never won a playoff series  So either way I m not sore about who wins or loses    But I see a lot of press about how bad Tampa is doing  but not much about how well Columbus is doing  If anyone has watched the games  Columbus isn t beating Tampa on lucky shots  bad penalties  or bounces    they re just straight up beating them  Tampa hasn t really shown up to play   There are many reasons this could be  but I d like to say Columbus is doing really well  Their not cheesing their way through this serious on luck and bad bounces   I know there are waves of salty Tampa fans  which I get  But be salty at your own team  don t take it out on other fans  I mean   ofcourse defend yourself  But some fans are just rampaging over others for no reason  It s not other peoples fault Tampa is self destructing  Stamkos is doing nothing  Kucherov is having tantrums  Hedman is injured  and Vasi has been shaky at best   To counter that Columbus is firing on all cylinders  so it s kind of a perfect storm   Either way I m happy  I have lots of respect for Tampa based on their season  and Columbus needs to win a playoff series ,Tampa Columbus series ,nhl

362,I m not a Lighting fan  so my idea isn t because of them getting swept  I m a Oilers fan but for the past couple months I ve heard countless people suggest that the playoff format needs to be changed  that the Leafs Bruins shouldn t be meeting in the  st round that the  th  amp   th best teams in the league shouldn t be eliminated after round   bc they need to face each other  So that got me thinking about the format  and I thought of a crazy yet fair format I believe  which applies to MLB NBA and NFL      The regular season SHOULD matter to teams and standings  So what I purpose is that you keep East  amp  West conferences  you could even keep divisions if you want  like is  and seed by overall standings  go back to     overall seeding  but here is my idea  The team who finishes  st  gets to pick outta the remaining   teams  who they wanna face  and then the  nd team decides and so on  With the higher seed always deciding who they wanna play with each round  It would create drama and place value on each position in the playoff as a reward for being a good team for a stretch of    games  I just think it would be pretty cool to start rivalries with teams that aren t forced upon each team based on geography  and a    min show like they do for the lottery would be pretty great tv for the playoff cities ,My Idea For A New Playoff Format ,nhl

3,I started watching hockey in the    s and hearing an opposing goalies name serenading the arena was fairly rare  This would usually happen when a team got up by    goals or when a goalie would let in a howler   Fast forward to       Come playoff time  this will happen in almost every game  It will also happen when the home team is STILL losing after just scoring  Most of the goals scored to spark these chants will not be the goalie s fault  yet they will still go on    At this point  the chanting is so prevalent that it s completely lost it s allure  It s basically a thing to do when your team scores  I can t see it affecting the goalie cause it s pretty much an extra horn going off after the goal    Can we please stop with this nonsense  I know it won t actually stop but maybe I can reach at least one fan with this post  ,Can we please chill when it comes to chanting an opposing goalie s name ,nhl

45,March      Toronto Maple Leafs  St  Pats  vs Philadelphia Flyers   During the first period  with about     minutes left the leafs had strong pressure on philly  While the puck was in the corner  the philly goalie put tremendous pressure from his left skate into the goal post  effectivly taking the net off  No pressure infront of the net  The net is now slightly off and seconds later  Toronto scores   The goal is called off because the net was off   Anyone who has touched a nhl net knows  they are pretty fuckin solid  This goalie was NOT contacted and put the net off  on his own  For more proof  they did not repair the net peg hole  they just put the net back on  insinuating it was up to code and secure prior and after this event   It is quite clear the goalie pushed his own net off when he felt pressured and a goal was called back because of this    How come this is not a penalty agaisnt the goalie  This strongly implies any goalie can just kick the net off  while hugging the post  just push it off  and be safe if a goal is scored before the refs shut down the play  Even then  if there is pressure from  say  a delayed penalty call  the goalie can just kick his net off   Am I missing something  ,This makes no sense,nhl

53,It s that time of the year again in the Hockey season where two points are crucial  and everyone on the team must put in a big contribution  Fans and analysts after every game look immediately to the wild card standings in every division but  specifically today were taking a look at the Atlantic Division playoff race  With the Tampa Bay Lightning clinching a playoff spot already  and most likely securing first in the division  we take a look at the Boston Bruins  Toronto Maple Leafs and the Montreal Canadiens         Bruins vs  Maple Leafs  Boston vs Toronto is very likely to happen in the first round yet again  which is concerning for Maple Leafs fans as the Leafs don t fair well with the Bruins in recent history  Boston has taken the last two series in Game   over the Leafs who had horrible meltdowns in TD Garden  So  the Maple Leafs this year are trying very hard to get the second place slot in the division in order to start the series at home and maybe end the series at home in a possible Game   scenario  Here is a quick look at both teams next   games on the schedule        BOS    March      Winnipeg L   March    vs  Columbus  March      New York Islanders  March      New Jersey and March      Florida   One home game  four away games  Three games vs  playoff teams  two games vs  non playoff teams        TOR    March    vs  Chicago L   March    vs  Philadelphia W   March      Ottawa  March      Nashville and March      Buffalo     Two home games  three away games  One game vs  playoff team  four games vs  non playoff teams       The schedule seems to be leaning towards the Maple Leafs but the Boston Bruins are the Boston Bruins and are a powerhouse when everyone is clicking  With less than a month left in the NHL regular season  the second place position in the Atlantic Division is still at large       Montreal Canadiens  The Montreal Canadiens are currently just outside of the last wild card spot which is held by the Columbus Blue Jackets  No one thought that the Canadiens would be in the conversation of playoff hockey at the beginning of the season but  with players like Brendan Gallagher  Shea Weber  Tomas Tatar  Carey Price and so on  giving them a chance every night helps their hopes of playing playoff hockey  Montreal recently suffered bad losses to San Jose       and Anaheim       on their annual California road trip hurts a ton when collecting key points  Their schedule ahead however might give the players and fans some hope      March      New York Islanders  L   March    vs  Chicago  March      Philadelphia  March    vs  New York Islanders  March    vs Buffalo   Three home games  two away games  Two games vs  playoff teams  three games vs non playoff teams      The one game that has to be a for sure win is against the Flyers on March     The Canadiens need to grab all two points in this one because the Flyers are right behind their tail in the wild card fight and could be massive to spread the gap between these two teams  The Canadiens last five games to end the regular season are going to be tough playing five high placed playoff teams  Columbus  Washington  Winnipeg  Tampa Bay and Toronto  So  if they are going to have a chance to squeak in  I strongly believe they need to win their next few games  Carey Price needs to play like         Carey Price down the stretch and they need to generate more opportunities and goals on the power play as they sit   st with a power play percentage at      percent     amp  x   B    The BRKDWN Sports   ,Atlantic Division Playoff Preview       ,nhl

166,Points  ROW  H H points and GD are all tied at the end of the season   I remember finding out last year if there is such a tie for the last playoff spot there would be a play in game but what if both teams are getting in anyways  Who gets which opponent  If it s a tie between  nd  rd in the same division who d get home ice advantage ,Who would get the higher seed if,nhl
168,There are about    teams that are out of the playoffs with about   or   games left   I hate that fans of non playoff bound teams want their teams to lose in order to increase their draft position   Here s an idea on how to incentivize winning for non playoff teams  At the end of the season group the teams with the five worst records   The team with the best record in the group over the final    games wins the first pick   Second best gets second pick etc   Then take the next   worst teams   Same thing   Best record in that group gets pick number     Then take the remaining non playoff teams   Same   The team with the best record would get pick number      Would that not make for some pretty damn exciting games at the end of the year between say  LA and Anaheim  or Ottawa and New Jersey   Coaches and GMs would ice the best team possible and fans wouldn t have to feel torn between wanting their team to win or lose   ,My idea on how to prevent teams  and fans  from tanking on purpose ,nhl

176,   So  after the Oilers dropped not one but TWO games against Ottawa  I ve  been thinking the Oilers roster while maybe lacking still doesn t  compare to the dungheap that is Ottawa   So why can t the Oilers at  least be somewhat more competitive with a player racking up as many  points as Mcdavid   As has been noted  early on about the TYPE of game he plays is very similar to a player  like T  Hall  so much so that Hall wasn t able to fit too well next to  Mcdavid because of the overlapping in roles  Draisatl complimented  Mcdavid much better    Of course Mcdavid is much more efficient at it  than Hall  but still it s a hard type of game to build your team play  around because it s mostly passive and relies on waiting for soft  openings to appear   Mcdavid s game doesn t seem to elevate his team  much   I have included a couple of clips to make my point more clear       Note how he is behind the players so he can get clear lanes to rush       gets away a lot with pushing player s out of his way lol  doesn t try too hard      He s not someone who attacks teams head on  confronting them front and center       He likes to lay low til opportunity arises  wait for a loose puck that  happens to pop out behind the guys battling for it so that he can jump  on it with no one around      He mostly only drives to the net on a rush where he can catch guys backpedaling on their heels a bit       He doesn t make up for areas where other player s on his team are  lacking  he doesn t back them up so that even if a player on his team  does mes up at least they won t have to pay for it       He s not a player who s going to go out and take care of handling the  tougher aspects involved in playing an opponent  he doesn t prevent the  opposition from playing their game       He isn t pushing the opposition s strengths back and opening up a path  for his team to follow   His game isn t forceful enough to soften up  hard opponents   I m not saying he  should play a different type of game  it s clearly effective for him and  points are points    But I don t think his style of play is the most  conducive for making a team more competitive ,Is Mcdavid too much of an opportunistic type player to carry a team ,nhl

178,So with the OHL draft steadily approaching  I learned of the consensus number   pick Shane Wright and how he received exceptional status  I decided to do a bit of research around the honor of exceptional status and when I came across the names of former OHL specific exceptional status players  one really caught my eye in Sean Day   So who is Sean Day  Day is a    year old defenceman playing in the echl for the Maine Mariners which may come as a surprise after reading the names he is in company with  Sean is a former  rd round pick of the New York Rangers   Backstory   When Sean was just a    year old kid he was already a full grown man standing at     and     lbs  Day also had the skills to back up his size  A Michigan Based NHL scout described Day as  What Paul Coffey would have looked like at the same age fastest thing on the ice   Later on in that year  Day and his family would submit his name for exceptional status consideration in which he would be granted  At the time Day would have been the  th player in OHL history to qualify for exceptional status alongside Mcdavid  Tavares and Ekblad  At age    Sean Day would be drafted by the Missisauga Steelheads fourth overall in the OHL draft behind Travis Konecny  Dylan Strome and Matthew Spencer  Pick    in that draft was Mitch Marner  pick    was Matthew Tkachuk  In his rookie season with Missisauga  Day would score   goals and    assists for    points in    games  which was not a bad rookie season especially for a    year old defenceman  It is the following season where Day would raise his season numbers to    goals and    assists for    points in    games which was a positive sign  However in Day s draft year of      where he was supposed to really take his game to the next level and compete to be a top    selection he had a very underwhelming performance putting up just   goals and    assists for    points leading to be a  rd rounder in that years draft    amp  x   B   What Happened   Nobody could really explain what had happened to Sean Day completely  however certain scouts were beginning to point out red flags in his game  For example one OHL scout said  He could get by on ability alone  His hockey sense and competitiveness were nowhere near Ekblads at the same age  Fact is it almost seemed like he got bored when he played   Day was also seen as uncommitted and childish at times  when asked what he needed to work on most with NHL central scouting Day replied with  weight control  which proved to be true as he was cut from the U   Canadian team after showing up late to the tryout and weighing in at just under    lbs  So really it seems that maturity and commitment is what really held back Sean as he clearly had the Skills to be a successful NHL player     amp  x   B   Whats Next   For Sean the future seems to be quite unclear  If he continues to act this way I see no scenario where he makes the NHL  However it is clear that he has the talent to be a successful NHL player so if he can turn himself around he could one day make it  Day needs to start small though  playing for the Maine Mariners Day has   goals and    assists for    points in    games which earned him a spot on Hartford where he has   goals and   assists for    points in    games  Day is going to need to drastically improve his game in his own end however as he is a minus    on the season and with production like he has been showing he will not make it to the league  Personally I see day as a career AHL player ,Tavares  Mcdavid  Ekblad and    Sean Day ,nhl

382,I ll go first     Series you re looking forward to most   East   I m a Bruins fan  so I m biased   But Boston Toronto is gonna be a heated rematch from last year  West  Really looking forward to Vegas San Jose   Wouldn t be surprised if the winner goes in to play on the Western conference finals    Upsets  to watch for   Use that term loosely because it s the NHL   East  Nothing would surprise me outside of a first round Tampa loss  but my sneaky pick would be those jerks in Carolina ousting the champs   Just sounds like something a jerk would do   West  Vegas wouldn t shock me although I picked the Sharks in    Eastern Conference Champs  I want the B s and wouldn t be surprised if they went on a run  but despite all their high powered offense in Tampa  I think they win he East due to the best goalie in the world  Vasilevskiy   pukes down front of hoodie  All that said  GO CBJ    Western Conference Champs  A great argument can be made for the top   teams I feel  but in the playoffs with Rinne and that D corps  my nod goes to Smashville until they prove me wrong    Stanley Cup Champs  My brain says Tampa but my heart will be with Nashville of this is the case   Nashville will need a near perfect and a very disciplined series  but stranger things have happened  and likely will    Preds in a phenomenal   game series      ,Brackets are out  Who ya got   ,nhl

392,In my opinion     TB vs CLB     I don t believe Columbus will upset Tampa  they don t seem like that team     BOS vs TOR     Likely that Toronto could pull it off  but don t put Gardiner in game   to secure a chance     WSH vs CAR     Carolina could potentially pull an upset  but it ll be hard to do with Ovie  Kuzy   amp  Holtby on the other team     NYI vs PIT     It s fair game  go Isles      CGY vs COL     It s not likely for an upset  To me  this series is more like WSH vs CAR  but in the west     VGK vs SJ     This could go anyway     NSH vs DAL     If Bishop is out  Khudobin has to stand on his head this series to upset Smashville     WPG vs STL     Laine is too busy playing FortNite  and can t put up points against the Blues  jk  St  Louis is heating up at the right time right when Winnipeg is cooling down at the wrong time  Overall  it s highly probable that St  Louis upsets Winnipeg in the first round   What are your thoughts on possible upsets ,Which NHL team will pull an upset in the  st round ,nhl

98,It s always seemed very odd to me that so much of Twitter   feminists and  lol  male feminists   scumbag low IQ rival fans  continue to treat Kane on Twitter as if he s a rapist  It would be difficult  short of an accuser holding a press conference to publicly recant and admit it was all made up  for an accused to be more fully  clearly  or explicitly exonerated by investigators than Kane was of that crime  He did not do it  It really isn t up for debate or subject to interpretation  He did not rape that girl  All evidence indicates he was the victim of a brutal false accusation and extortion attempt by a family that had a reputation locally for such underhanded things  they have since fled the area as a family in ignominy  relocating to the south atlantic coast  there presumably to continue their lives as grifters    amp  x   B   Patrick Kane can hardly be mentioned on Twitter without at least one reply of  She said no   But the girl in question has likely never or nearly never said no in her life  both by the accounts of those who know her  and the physical evidence in the case  which found multiple men s semen samples in her underwear  neither of which belonged to the man she was accusing of having raped her  She didn t say no   Patrick Kane said no  He said  No  you cannot get millions of dollars as a reward for falsely accusing me of a heinous crime and dragging my name through the mud and putting my family through Hell  endangering my freedom  my future  my livelihood  No  you go away  Kane won that case by saying no  if you remember back  As did the Blackhawks  Do you remember the atmosphere  Everyone was waiting for the Hawks or the NHL to  do something  to him  Meanwhile the extortionist and her family and her lawyer were waiting for Kane to break  to finally pay them   figures to go away and leave him alone  But the extortionist didn t realize who she was dealing with  And the media monsters in Chicago didn t realize who they were dealing with  in the Hawks organization  Kane didn t get to be where and who he is by being weak  by being scared  by running away  By letting pressure break him  Time passed and as time passed the pressure went off of Kane and onto his extortionist and her party  as their desperate attempt to rob this innocent man fell apart  The pressure went onto them and it broke them  In their desperation  seeing their cash grab fall apart before their eyes  they brazenly tampered with evidence in the vain hope of salvaging their leverage  they did not of course ever want or intend the thing to go to trial  but with no evidence  with physical evidence pointing to complete innocence  with multiple supposed eyewitnesses  friends of the girl  backing out of their support of her version of events  they had lost any leverage in the extortion attempt  Kane had called their bluff and won   Then their lawyer quit  then the extortionist gave up so as not to be charged herself  then the DA said enough and gave a press conference saying he had been closer to charging the girl than Kane  And clearing him of any guilt    amp  x   B   All of that happened  It is all true  You can go check  It all happened in broad daylight  It made the news  Then Kane returned to the ice and won the MVP  He was pissed  No one in the Chicago media ever apologized for treating him like a rapist scumbag criminal for months  for saying he should be traded or released or suspended  for treating him as if he were guilty  And no one ever has  The girl  the extortionist  continued cheerleading at Buffalo  faced no suspension  no scrutiny  no charges  Ever  But locals knew what she was and what she d done  what her family was and what they d done  And so the family packed up and relocated  having worn out their welcome  To this day this girl can still be seen on social media coming on to pro athletes  I hope her name is known to them and none of them ever get caught near her  Patrick Kane was not her first victim     amp  x   B   Now  All that being true  what kind of absolute scumbag liar piece of filth must one be to waltz into a Pat Kane mention on Twitter and say   She said no   Or call him a rapist  Or say   and this is the other common one   that guys with money like he has have a way of getting away with things  His money is why he got away with it  No  his money is why he was targeted  it s why he was victimized  A regular schlub isn t getting that accusation from that human shark  bc there is no wealth to steal  And then there are the dozens of references  any time he s mentioned on Twitter  of things like  Great player  shit human being   Or the usual from girls  openly feminist  acting as if he s a rapist  treating him like he s subhuman or scum of the earth   He makes me throw up   If you asked them why  what would they say  Some would at least have the good grace to not claim it s bc of a rape accusation he was the only victim of  These liars say it s bc of the cab driver thing or his drunken Cinco De Mayo antics from when he was a kid  But of course that s horse shit  and none of them were saying any such things about him prior to the rape case  The feminists meanwhile would just say it s bc he s a rapist  He isn t  but if you say he is  it ll be as if he is  I guess    amp  x   B   Anyway here s to Patrick Kane  A great player  A great teammate and friend  I have been watching hockey a long time and have never heard teammates speak as glowingly of a teammate as guys like Sharp and Burish and Panarin do of Kane  whom they clearly love   a good guy in the community  a good guy to fans  Was he a drunken punk and womanizer when he was a college age kid playing in the NHL  By all accounts  sure was  Is he fundamentally a bad guy  No one who has had dealings with him the past many years has ever said so  The nastiness and intensity of the attacks on this man s character are the most unfair and cruel thing I have ever seen in my life as a sports fan  The way he has conducted his career on ice has of course been exemplary  he is the greatest US player of all time  and imo the best player or certainly a top   player of his generation   and the modern player I would most want on the ice in a game   to decide it all   But the way he conducted himself OFF the ice when faced with that firestorm  that proto  MeToo witch hunt and legal extortion attempt and media coordinated relentless attack on him was   amazing  He was as strong and calm and clutch and skilled off the ice in that instance  as graceful  as he has ever been on it  He rose to the occasion  And he has never shrunk since  I am writing all this in part bc he has never written all this  or said all this  He has never said a word about any of it after his brief to the point statement of fact at the time that he had done nothing wrong  He s let the scumbags continue to drag his name through the mud  hurt his family  and speak their evil lies with impunity  So  Let the record show    KaneForHart,Two of the most common anti Patrick Kane memes on Twitter have it exactly backwards ,nhl

255,Mats Zuccarello  RW   a k a   the Wizard    the Hobit   should have been completely off limits in the trade market  He is irreplaceable   both on  and off the ice   Zuccarello is the ultimate team player  I say this because  he takes team friendly contracts so the Rangers have cap space to sign other elite players  he s the nucleus and core of NYR that makes their orbit turn  has consistently been the white knight   especially during the deep playoff runs over the years  which resulted in one Stanley Cup final appearance   He is easily one of the most underrated NHL players  with smarts that mirror some of the most brilliant players in the league   such as Patrick Kane  He makes everyone he plays with much  much better because of his high end play making ability and hockey IQ   In the nine years I ve watched him play for the Rangers  never once did I see a lousy shift or pass from him   only high risk passes and shots that seem to always connect to teammates  or land in the back of opponents net    Let s look at some of Zuc s statistics during his nine year tenure with the Rangers to get a perspective of how much he contributes    Disclaimer   I ll be using the metric called  Corsi  to make my case  Corsi is a fancy term for overall shot attempts  shots   missed shots   blocked shots  not counting empty net shots   it measures a player or team s puck possession at even strength  A player  or team  is considered elite if they have a Corsi that falls in the range of     or higher   and players teams that fall below     are considered below average    So let s start here  Zuccarello has a corsi of       in the nine seasons he played for the Rangers  in which he played     games  and had a total of       minutes on ice  He never fell below       in each of those nine seasons  and had several years where he was in the high fifties and sixties    What I m saying is Zuccarello dominates opposition when he s on the ice   and gives the Rangers quality scoring opportunities that result in winning games    Again  it will be very difficult to replace what Zuccarello brought to the table   It s a grim time for  Rag fans   as in you can t count on them to make quality trades  nor are they legitimately formidable at drafting quality players  In other words  don t count on a Stanley Cup being raised at Madison Square Garden  MSG  anytime soon   Zuc has a career total of     points      goals      assists   and is plus    during regular season play   and has    points     goals     assists  in    playoff games  He has    career power play points during the regular season as well   I wish  the Wizard  all the success going forward for the Dallas Stars  and any other teams he may play on in the future   Henrik Lundqvist s reaction  when asked by reporters about what  Zuc meant to the Rangers  sums up how all Rangers fans feel during this time of mourning      ,Farewell to Mats Zuccarello From A New York Rangers Fan,nhl

291,I am a fed up fan of the Ducks  and I want to get the truth out there about the question   How do we judge Bob Murray s tenure as GM of the Ducks   so I am posting it here  to neutral NHL fans of all teams  where it can be judged fairly  instead of with the bias that can often come with being a fan of the Ducks or any team  The reason the title refers to SJ is  what better way to judge Murray s performance than by comparing him to Pac division rival GMs  Here I go    In the time Murray has been Ducks GM  Sharks GM Doug Wilson has added six top players  and given up none to get them  These are as follows  Brent Burns  Dany Heatley  Erik Karlsson  Dan Boyle  Evander Kane  Gustav Nyquist  Before that  he acquired Joe Thornton    In that same time  Murray s only  top  addition was an already declining  injury prone Ryan Kesler  in his late twenties  one year away from an   year contract extension that would include maybe   more good  but declining  seasons  then     seasons of paying an AHL player   million a year  I wonder why Wilson and other GMs passed on that one   In that same time  Murray has TRADED the following players  Andy Mcdonald  Chris Pronger  for injury prone Lupul and low skill Luca Sbisa   Bobby Ryan  but only let teams willing to acquire him without sending salary back bid on him  killing the market  even though he had cap room and would have had more had he not given out so many bad contracts like    mil a year to Clayton Stoner and Bryan Allen on multi year deals   Brandon Montour  William Karlsson  Jake Gardiner  for an aging Beauchemin Murray let go from the Ducks the prior offseason over money and term  then he traded Gardiner to acquire him at that money and term  Doh   Kyle Palmieri  for a lone  nd round pick   lost Shea Theodore and Justin Schultz for nothing  and let once promising prospects like Emerson Etem and Peter Holland  former  st round picks of his  and Devante Smith Pelly  I believe a  nd round pick of his  lose all their value without trading them  despite the Ducks being in a contending window   When it comes to     on adding losing elite players  defined as top line forward or top pairing DMAN   over the last    years  Murray has lost six  Pronger  Bobby Ryan  Brandon Montour soon to be a legit    IMO but we can judge      fairly in say two years  W  Karlsson  Shea Theodore  Kyle Palmieri   and acquired six  He is    in the plus minus of acquiring top line pair players during his ten year tenure    Doug Wilson is    in just the last year     at minimum if you dont count Nyquist  high skill    off    pts in    games   as a top line player  Over the last ten years  he is     added Burns  Boyle  Kane  Heatley  Nyquist  traded away none     In terms of trading away vs acquiring YOUNG  let s say    years old and younger  top six top four talent  Murray has also acquired ZERO during his ten year tenure  with Daniel Sprong being his latest but also best hope  while losing    Karlsson  Theodore  Montour  Schultz  Gardiner   so he is     Doug Wilson I think acquired none but unlike Murray  lost none either  that I can recall   I just wanted to put this out there  VGK GM George Mcphee has also traded for more top players in     years as VGK GM than Murray has in    years  The Flames have also traded for   young potential top line top pair players this season  Lindholm and Hanifin  but only gave up one  and a top prospect  Murray traded all the players AND top prospects I already mentioned and got NONE back  And when the Ducks and Kings were both contending side by side    years ago  the Kings were actually out of a playoff spot and they traded for Jeff Carter  an elite top line center or winger  which pushed them over the top to their first Cup  then two years later in a similar situation  they traded for Marian Gaborik s last couple top line ish seasons  leading to a second Cup  Murray as usual either did nothing at all  or something very damaging to the franchise  like William Karlsson AND A  nd ROUND PICK in exchange for old injured James Wisniewski at the deadline  who then despite getting healthy was healthy scratched the entire playoff run because the coach didn t even think he was good enough to play  But he was good enough to give up William Karlsson and a  nd round pick for   but nothing good    Is it any wonder that when the elite players Bob Murray INHERITED when becoming Ducks GM  like Getzlaf and Perry  were still in their primes  the Ducks STILL could never get over the top  and now that they are no longer in their primes  and the team is now for the first time basically entirely of Bob Murray s making  that the Ducks are one of the worst teams in the NHL   Is it any wonder that with all that talent given away over the last    years  and ZERO of consequence acquired outside of one good complementary player  Silfverberg  now likely overpaid  and a declining  nd liner  Kesler   that when the few elite players you had because you INHERITED them finally decline  WHICH IS KNOWN TO HAPPEN    years down the line but shh no one tell Murray that  your team will fall into the basement of the NHL   I mean  who could have predicted such a thing  That s why I personally hope Murray is replaced ASAP  Clearly the team will never win another Cup with this level of incompetent leadership  Half the good young players are traded  along with half the top NHL players  yet ZERO good young players OR top NHL players are brought back  And now that Perry and Getzlaf are getting old  maybe Ducks ownership  and its many fans who keep deriding me for speaking the truth about this  will start to realize that s not a winning recipe  and never was  outside of Getzlaf and Perry still being there to carry the team and cover up for Murray s incompetence  I didn t even get into the Kevin Bieksa extension before he ever played a game for the Ducks  which included a NMC  which led a SECOND avoidable situation where Murray chose to let Shea Theodore walk rather than be  unloyal  to Bieksa and ask him to waive his NTC even though Vegas never would have picked him  along with the fact that Murray needed that move to unload the OTHER  mil   per year multi year contract he gave out to ANOTHER gritty character pylon  in this case Clayton Stoner  Two awful mistakes put Murray in a situation to lose one of his young dmen  then he made the third mistake to go through with it instead of just asking Bieksa to waive his NMC and buying out Stoner  then he made a fourth mistake giving up Theodore instead of Montour just because Montour had a better postseason  i e  recency bias  OK now I did get into it  Lol    And there are so many other examples  So I really hope taking the time to write this post at least gets the word out a little bit  and maybe it can lead to the changes occurring in Anaheim that need to if the team is ever going to be successful again  Thank you for your time reading  ,In the last  yrs  Ducks GM B M  has lost TWO top line pair players  Theodore  amp  W  Karlsson  for nothing  Hes been Ducks GM    yrs   amp  has acquired ZERO top line Fs or top pair dmen  His rival GM  Doug Wilson  has acquired THREE such players  E Karlsson  Kane  Nyquist  in just the last ONE yr,nhl

374,Mark Stone is big  skilled  great shot  great passer  great hockey sense  a smart defensive player with a great stick    and yet  he s not the fastest player   When I think of all the forwards the last    years or so who were slow  yet either produced as top offensive players for multiple years  or even just had one breakout year  these are some of the first names I think of     Ryan Getzlaf  Corey Perry  Bobby Ryan  Dany Heatley  Derek Stepan  Ryan Callahan  Dustin Brown  Anze Kopitar  Milan Lucic  David Backes  Jason Spezza  Joe Pavelski  Patrick Hornqvist  Adam Henrique  John Tavares  David Clarkson  Mike Richards  Ville Leino  James Neal  Joe Thornton  etc   Almost every single one of them hit a wall  offensively  very early in their carers  relatively speaking  in many cases before    years old  that in many cases lasted permanently  or in other cases only returned inconsistently at best  except for just a few players like Ryan Getzlaf  who is finally now the last year or two starting to decline as well  at       years old  Mark Stone s contract runs until         Joe Thornton  in his prime  a     point player  Stone s career high is what       Anze Kopitar  even he has had mysteriously bad down years of production  and his goal scoring has never matched what Kings fans expected from someone as big and skilled  with a good shot  like he has  Hard to imagine why      and    actually that s it   Is Mark Stone  at age     even on the level that Ryan Getzlaf was age     Even John Tavares looked like a non factor to start last season  then he found his legs and has been on a tear ever since  including this season  but how long will it last  Even if Tavares  prime lasts until     has Mark Stone ever been on Tavares level  Up until this year when Toews refound his legs  he had also declined well before age     yet at age     I d say he was much faster and better than Stone is now  So if he couldn t last as a top line player until age     barring this season and who knows how long the resurgence lasts  will Stone   See what I m saying  Dany Heatley was a    goal scorer  then couldnt even play in the NHL anymore  Corey Perry and Bobby Ryan were both I believe     goal scorers in their primes  Perry hit     yet both are now bottom six players basically well before age      Now I understand  Stone is much better defensively than Heatley and even Perry  That s fine  I don t dispute that  So was Ryan Kesler but by age    or    he was also an   million dollar per year player who really didn t belong above the  rd or  th line  defensive ability or not  and Mark Stone is signed at     until age     so     I d just be a little concerned about it if I were the Vegas Golden Knights GM George Mcphee  and ironically it s the deal I would be least concerned about  It s crazy to think just in the last year how he has traded a  st round pick  two or three  nd round picks  two of his organization s three best prospects   and  committed    million dollars PER YEAR in salary cap space to three players for the next   to   years  all just to make his team SLOWER lol  I don t get it at all  Adding Mark Stone is one thing  probably not for   years but for the next    sure  but you d think the rest of that money and those assets would have been put towards making the team faster and building on what made the VGK stand out last year  rather than on seemingly declining  seemingly one dimensional  seemingly no longer fast  players  ,In terms of speed  is Mark Stone going to be able to keep up with the NHL as a top offensive producer in     years ,nhl

480,Some people have been really up in arms about the skater hitting the brakes and slowing down to a crawl in the shootout  in order to stick handle back and forth and back the goalie way into the net   I understand why some feel forward momentum is a problem here   There s also people defending the move  i e  those saying the goalie could just poke check the guy    But if it were that easy goalies would be doing it    Idea    What if    there was a defender who got to try and chase down the shooter   The defender backchecker could start at the hash marks or further back and the shooter at the red line or blue line   This would simulate a little more of a  hockey play    or a breakaway situation where someone could get back and help the goalie   Similar rules for the backchecker could apply where you have to use a different guy each round   Maybe not be able to use a chaser once he s shot or vice versa   It would make the shootout a little more intense  You d lose some of the phenomenal moves you see because of the speed but you d also see a host of different moves because you d have to protect the puck   Shooters who come in at a half decent pace would probably mostly be unaffected by the backchecker   But it would put some pressure on them knowing they could be caught   Thoughts   ,New Shootout Idea   Chaser,nhl

495,TL DR   Instead of going back to playoff seeding being based on conference standing      go to   Wild Card teams per conference    amp  x   B   I saw over on stonBruins that with Vegas beating Calgary last night  the Bruins had moved into  nd in the league behind Tampa thanks to fewer games played  Immediately  I thought about last year s Western Conference playoffs where we saw the Predators and the Jets square off in the  nd round  even though those two teams held the first and second best records in the league respectively  I know there s been a lot of talk about moving back to the playoff seeding being based on     in the conference  but it sounds like the league has no plans to even consider making that change   All that said  I feel as though the best chance of getting a change to the playoff format would come next off season  right before Seattle enters the league  With their entry  each division will once again have an even number of teams  thus solving the problem that the current wild card format sought to fix   My thought is to expand the wild card pool  So instead of having each division with three teams make the playoffs and then two conference based wild cards  go to each division sending two teams  with four conference based wild cards  The teams that clinched playoff births through divisional play will automatically get home ice  and the four divisional teams will be matched up with the wild cards based on overall record    So taking this year s Eastern Conference standings at the moment  the first round would be as follows    amp  x   B   A  TBL vs WC  MTL         M  WAS vs WC  CAR  A  BOS vs WC  PIT          M  NYI vs WC  TOR   amp  x   B   For comparison s sake  this is what this year would look like with     seeding    amp  x   B     TBL v   MTL    BOS v   PIT    TOR v   CAR    WAS v   NYI   amp  x   B   As far as second round matchups are concerned  the format wouldn t change  Clearly  in this scenario   Boston and Toronto avoid each other in the first round  therefore increasing the chances that we see teams with better records go deeper  Although Boston still runs into Tampa in the second round in this scenario  if they win their series  the winner of that round still has a chance to get Toronto in the ECF    amp  x   B   Curious what everyone thinks  Feel free to add or modify if you have any ideas that might improve this format ,Tweaking the Playoff Seeding Format,nhl

66,So  to preface  I m not the best hockey fan  I love the sport to death  but I haven t been able to reliably keep up with hockey most of my adult life because of life  football  and more life because I m super busy  I am now super invested in my team by looking at stats and potential trades and what our future outlook looks like  I m about to un cut the cord and get a cable box to watch the local games  I don t want to miss any more hockey   Originally  I was a Devils fan  That came about because the first video game I was able to purchase with my own money was NHL Hitz       for    brand new at Sears  I LOVED that game  Played the absolute tits off of it even though I knew nothing of hockey  And because I knew nothing about hockey  I knew I needed a good goal tender  so I picked the team with the best goalie  who at the time was Martin Brodeur    I only played with the Devils and I beat that game to death  I grew to love the whole team  Elias  Gomez  Neidermayar  Stevens  etc     then I started watching the Stanley Cup Playoffs that year and we won the Stanley Cup  much to the chagrin of my dad s friend my peewee football coach  who was a giant Rangers fan  And I was hooked   until the next regular season started   Since then  I never really consistently kept up with regular season hockey because it just wasn t something I thought about  It wasn t something my dad was very into  I was the only person in my friend group that even remotely gave a shit about hockey  So my love for hockey would be pretty dormant until playoff time  I d watch the Devils play in super tight games during the playoffs and I watched them sputter against LA in        The hardest thing for me to come to terms with though is the loss in the playoffs to the Hurricanes in the      playoffs    My family and I moved to NC in      because my parents were both in the military  I didn t even know Carolina had a hockey team until I saw them play the Devils in the playoffs  so for me  when the Canes beat the Devils  I haaaaated the Hurricanes for being so damn lucky  But in the years since that series  I ve gone to school  graduated  became a professional and moved to the Triangle area  where there resides a professional hockey team that I ve hated for all my teenage years   I ve grown apart from the Devils  I hadn t watched them in a long time until last year because I only made time to watch playoff hockey in the spring  As much love as I got for them and their up and coming young guys  I just don t feel connected to that team anymore  even a fraction of what I felt than when Brodeur was still there   And as my love for the Devils had drifted away  I ve grown to love the Canes since moving here a year and a half ago  It s easier to now  especially since we ve hit a bit of an unprecedented hot streak  but I know in the back of my mind that I hate the idea of switching teams  I ve been a Raider fan all my life  so I know how to watch a sucky team suck for decades on end and I m aware of the turmoil the Canes have suffered until recently  I m as loyal as they come  so for me the idea of switching teams is almost blasphemous  especially when you throw around the term  bandwagoner   It s like flirting with hotter women behind your spouse s back when she s ill  I feel like I ve betrayed myself  but rooting for my hometown team just feels right   it s not something I ve ever had the pleasure of experiencing before now because until recently I ve never lived in a city with a professional sports team   And I guess there isn t any real reason for me to post this other than for my own catharsis  I want to not feel bad for switching because I m not accountable to anybody else but myself  but I do  The Devils gave me some great moments  but I m happy for my hometown team to give me a reason to watch seek out hockey  I love this sport dearly and I m grateful for this current Hurricanes team to reignite some of the feelings I had when I was a kid   Somebody tell me it s okay  Haha  TLDR  I was a Devils fan as a kid  lived in NC for almost    years  I want to watch more exciting hockey so I m a Canes fan now  but I m dealing with it ,I hate team switchers  but I m switching teams ,nhl

94,It s always struck me as odd that the metric we use to measure the effective of power plays is the percentage of power plays they score on  By having a set denominator  you ignore all kinds of nuances in a power play s effectiveness  For example  if a team fails to score on a two minute minor  the     is the same as if they fail to score on a five minute major  and the same as if they fail to score on a    second fragmented PP  A goal score   seconds into the power play counts the same as a goal scored      in  There s no nuance to the stat for  say  a   on    which is much easier to score on than a   on    And  the king of example for why this is stupid  failing to score on a double minor    mins  is treated as worse than failing to score on a major    mins  despite being literally less power play time  You d get an     for the   and an     for the    We just get a percentage of PP goals out of total power plays  regardless of the actual situation of those power plays   My suggestion is the stat of expected goals per   minutes of power play time  or alternatively percentage of time a PP unit can be expected to score given   full minutes of   on     This would be easy to understand  easy to calculate  and a much more accurate measure of how effective a power play is  Then  you can weight goals scored on   on  s and   on  s and double goals on   minute majors  which right now are counted as     in theory a power play can actually be over      using this rule     Maybe I m missing something  and feel free to let me know if I am  I m also sure that some tinkering would have to be done  especially with weighting special situation goals  But to me it seems like this is a relatively easy change that would really help us better rate power plays ,The stupidity of our power play metric,nhl

145,Every time the NHL cancels one of the events we fans love like the Olympic or the World Cup I wonder why the players agree to play promotional games outside of the US or Canada  As a fan watching   exhausted teams play in China to start the season or head over for a game in Finland is not inspiring  It simply means they plan to expand the league in those directions which sucks for the players  way more travel away from the family  and sucks for the fans  games in bizarre time zones   Why doesn t the nhlpa tell the league where they can stuff those games the way the nhl has told the players they can forget the Olympics and World Cup  And if those are really  promotional  why don t they have a positive impact on raising the salary cap as they benefit the owners a heck of a lot more than the players  ,World Cup Olympics Marketing,nhl

169,Crazy concept  how about the teams get ranked based on their regular season points in each conference from      At which point  the    seed plays the    seed  the    plays        vs     and    vs     And then  get this  they reseed the bracket after each round  ensuring a balanced bracket  For those of you who haven t realized  my sarcastic tone is rooted in feelings of confusion and annoyance  The current system is stupid  The only point that I ve heard which supports the Wild Card format is that is promotes rivalries in the first round  when the NHL doesn t compete with major sports as much  For us die hards  who care more about the game than the revenue  it makes the later rounds less competitive when a team from a weaker division moves on the to conference finals  Also  going back to a seeded bracket makes it possible for new rivalries to be created  instead of seeing the same teams play each other year in and year out  Chicago Vancouver had a crazy rivalry because of the former system  Now  teams like Columbus and Toronto are left to fight against teams that can hold off in the regular season  like Pittsburgh  Washington  Boston or Tampa Bay  only to dominate in the post season  At one point this year  Vegas was  th in the league and  rd in the Pacific  There is no reason that they should have to work that hard only to be seeded against San Jose  at the time was  nd in the Pacific and  rd in the league  and lose home ice advantage  Finally  even the players dislike the current format  Let me know if y all disagree  PS  not a Leafs fan ,Playoff Format,nhl

204,The Athletic published a story indicating that despite the option to re open the league s collective bargaining agreement in September  the NHL and NHLPA share a mutual desire to avoid a work stoppage in       Author Pierre LeBrun reasoned that there is no   single   major issue    that is so paramount that either side wants to go to war over  it    While there s  cautious optimism  the   sides will be able to work out an agreement without a lockout  speculation about potential labor strife continues to exist because of the league s history  see    work stoppages in the last    years       Howie Long Short     Harvey Schiller is a distinguished sports executive  having served as Executive Director of the United States Olympic Committee  Chief Executive Officer of YankeeNets  President of Turner Sports and President of the Atlanta Thrashers  I asked the former NHL club executive  considering the owners got the hard cap  amp  larger percentage of gross revenues  from     to      they sought during the last round of negotiations    is there anything left to negotiate for that would be worth     locking the players out to get        Harvey      I don t think that there s any benefit to locking the players out  You don t want to hurt your fan base  You have some clubs just trying to survive  so  they need the revenue that the games bring   fan demographics are more fragmented than ever  and there are other sports trying to take the league s market share  you don t want to get crowded out while you re sitting at home doing nothing     There are also whispers of further expansion  You hear stories about Kansas City  Houston and maybe another club in the Toronto area  There s a lot of upside for the NHL  so it s not in their best interest to have a lockout    Unless there is a major issue that the public is not aware of  I would think that the owners would try to work something out      What would motivate the players to pass on concessions the owners might offer to extend the deal and strike        Harvey      That s a difficult question to answer  but the addition of new franchises  and the massive expansion fees they generate  is among the reasons  the players see that money coming in and want their share     I think that the players have gotten more sophisticated  see    record number of NCAA alumni    and they have access to more information with the rise of social media over the last    years  so  much of what the players desire on their end is a reflection of what s happened in the other  Big   sports  leagues with regards to market cap sharing etc  The competitiveness of the Russian league  the European leagues and the growth of the sport itself has also drawn more of the players  attention to the game s financials      Some of the league s biggest stars  see  Tavares  McDavid  Stamkos  signed front loaded contracts that have been touted as  lock out proof   Are the players prepared financially to withstand a lockout        Harvey      The concept of  lockout proof  contracts  that s all agent driven  it s a good opportunity for the top players to extract more from the teams up front  The problem of course is the drastic difference in salaries between the best players  Connor McDavid will make     million this season as the league s highest paid player  and the average or low salary players           season is the league minimum   The stars may have contracts that are  lockout proof   but most players don t and the players  association has to represent the needs and wishes of every player  they can t be solely representative of the league s elite players      You mentioned the Russian League  KHL  and some of the European Leagues  Wouldn t their existence give the players leverage in negotiations        Harvey      There s a big gap between the NHL and every other professional hockey league in terms of player compensation  NHL teams have       million to spend in            KHL teams will have just over     million to spend for the           season  it s not a viable alternative yet  but as those franchises become more valuable it ll likely become one       Fan Marino     U S  Olympic hockey has given sports fans thrills with both amateur collegiate  see            and NHL players  see  T J   Oshie    but there s no question it s more fun to compete with Canada  Czech Republic  Finland  Russia and Sweden  Big    when we send the professionals  The players want to play  but ownership understandably prefers their high price investments not take the additional    weeks in middle of season  risk   The Athletic said that gaining approval to participate in the Olympics is a  must  for the players this time around    Do you agree with that sentiment        Harvey      There s strong interest on the part of Russian players to participate for Russia   and maybe with players from a couple of other countries   but  it isn t the North American players clamoring to play  The players now participate in the World Championships  which gives them another venue to represent their country  I m not sure that the whole Olympic thing will be a sticking point in the

344,He had a fairly productive final season with   pts in    games     goals    Even with his mediocre playoff production that year  you d think some team would have taken a chance and given him a one year deal for a couple million  Even just having him there to mentor the young guys would probably make it a net positive    Why did he get no offers  Were teams worried that he was too injury prone at that point  Did the debacle with Yzerman somehow smear his reputation with GMs  ,How come no team took a chance on Martin St  Louis after        season ,nhl

392,People who cheer for the same team even when they suck for years and years out of loyalty are just sad   What are you cheering for   For decades at a time   All those people who cheered for the Cubs for     years before they finally won  how many people lived their whole lives and died without seeing a championship      I don t understand people who cheer for decaded for teams that suck because of loyalty   If your job sucked this bad would you keep working there or would you move on to a better job   I don t get this loyalty to crappy teams   Do you think they care about you or whether you watch  or buy their jerseys   Even the athletes don t care on those crappy teams   An anthlete would demand a trade to a contender instead of staying with a crappy team   So why would you keep cheering for decades for the same loser team     because of location     How does a Leafs fan keep cheering for a team that has not won anything or even won a round of the playoffs in   decades     or how are you still a St  Louis Blues fan or Florida Panthers fan or any other crappy team   I was a Vancouver Canucks fan for    years  waited and waited    failed Stanley Cups in             and       and in      finally fired the team  wasn t going to wait until I die to see a championship  Burned   hockey jerseys    tire cover    flags    mugs and   blankets and wrote a long letter to Canucks management and said I would not support their team or buy any more tickets and absolved myself of the team completely  and since then they have gotten worse and my new team the Golden Knights put up     points in their first season and I was there for the ride     My point is you can always fire your team and get a new team if your team sucks  because I would not want to be that Cubs fan who lived for a     years   hoping and praying and never seeing a championship   Team loyalty is all BS   If you want to feel sorry for yourself and cheer for a loser team your whole life  go ahead but I would much sooner become a Patriots fan and celebrate with them and enjoy life then be some drab depressed fan because I choose to cheer for loser teams for decades or centuries because of some BS loyality to a team     Unfortunately I don t follow football    amp  x   B   At least I have seen   World Series with my Yankees   amp  x   B ,Loyalty in sports teams is complete BS,nhl

398,Rebuilding has to be the worst excuse for a team to use on their fans   It s basically saying our team will suck for the next   years BUT please keep coming to games and spending money on our team while we do nothing for   years but make billions in revenue and hopefully we don t lose all our fans   So we will dangle that carrot promising that we will be good in   years just stick with us fans  Rebuilding is a lame excuse to give to fans ,Rebuild mode  just means our team will suck for the next   years and hope you don t leave us,nhl
401,Alright something   As we all know  or as some of us might not know   the NFL completely screwed over both football and SpongeBob fans alike with their halftime show at the Super Bowl  In tandem with that  the Dallas Stars playing Sweet Victory successfully in full at one of their games  and the fact that I ve always liked hockey the most out of all sports  I ve decided to get back into hockey   What do I mean by  get back into   Well  in terms of sports  I ve never really paid much attention to them  outside of a few teams I watched growing up  My grandpa raised me to be a Bears fan  and I d go with my dad to some baseball and hockey games in Evansville  IN whenever I was visiting  but I never really paid full attention to sports  I did watch the      World Cup  and it was nice to be able to pay attention to a sport and cheer for teams  vive la France    but I ve never really paid attention to anything hockey related for a while  the last team I kept up with was the Evansville Icemen  now the Jacksonville Icemen   but that was a minor league team  and I ve also since stopped visiting my dad  for various reasons   I want a major league team to cheer for  but I also don t want to be a bandwagoning asshole who only cheers for the most recent good team   With all of that being said  which team do you guys think I should become a fan of  Persuade me to join up with a fanbase  because I m legitimately curious ,Fight for your team,nhl

437,In my opinion I think Ovechkin is better than Gretzky because he is able to put up record breaking statistics in an era where it s harder to do that than ever  also when Gretzky played it looked insanely easy to score on a goalie because they were all stand up goalies who would just stand there and cover the middle of the net  ,Is Ovechkin Better Than Gretzky  I think so,nhl

181,I am and have been an Arizona fan ever since I went to my first game in      I was   so I don t remember much but I m pretty sure the coyotes didn t win  I remember a stretch of   seasons where they went to the playoffs and they got bounced by the redwings both times  It was extremely annoying and it made me hate players like Datsyuk Zetterberg and Lidstrom  I was finally happy when they got realigned to the east and thought the coyotes would be able to possibly get to the cup final  Then in the           season they lost to the kings in the conference final and it made me more mad because the kings were an  th seed  Then after that all hell broke loose and they haven t made the playoffs since  The team has been terrible since and hasn t been drafting well either due to missing out on generational talents in recent years like mcdavid  Arizona born Matthews  and even Elias Petterson  Now look Clayton Keller has been decent and isn t at the bust level of strome  Peter mueller  or mark visentin but he isn t panning out how thought  Unless the coyotes get Jack Hughes I don t see Arizona becoming better in the short time future  So my question is if dvorak  Barrett hayton Adin hill  and whatever future prospects the coyotes acquire pan out will they even have a possibility for just making it to the playoffs in even my lifetime  ,Will the Arizona Coyotes ever be good ,nhl
182,Been growing tired of the current point system where some games are worth   points and some are worth    I ve also grown tired of the novelty of shootouts and miss the days of ties  I know a lot of people in the current generation have grown up with a lot of soccer and wouldn t mind them either so I ve tried to create a system in which all games are worth   points except games which end in a tie after a   minute   on   overtime period  thus punishing both teams with   dropped points   thus increasing the value of points and regulation wins  This would also solve issues like discrepancies in the standings that show certain teams looking better than they really are  for example  teams like the         Calgary Flames that show a somewhat competitive  above                record  even though they lost    games and only won      It feels to me like the league is rewarding mediocrity and punishing dominance   The system would go W  pts  OTW  pts  L  pts  OTL T  pt   What I did find with this system when running it through the         standings was pretty interesting     EASTERN CONFERENCE    Metropolitan Division  WSH                   M   PIT                   M   PHI                   M   NJ                   WC   CLB                   would outright miss playoffs despite WC  in current system  CAR                  NYI                  NYR                   Atlantic Division  BOS                   A   TB                   A   TOR                   A   FLA                   WC   MTL                 DET                 OTT                 BUF                    WESTERN CONFERENCE    Central Division  WPG                   C   NSH                   C   MIN                   C   COL                   WC   STL                 DAL                  CHI                   Pacific Division  VGK                   P   ANA                   P   SJ                   P   LA                   WC   CGY                  VAN                 EDM                 ARI                  One thing I noticed last season was that despite Florida picking up a lot of regulation and blow out wins down the stretch  they couldn t gain any ground on Columbus and New Jersey despite their far less dominant wins often ending in overtime or shootouts  in fact if they were placed in the Metro  with this system they would have placed  nd ahead of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia   the ROW tiebreaker can only do so much   this system s tiebreaker being regulation wins  I do feel this system allows a truer standings and encourages a more offensive style of play to gain that extra point for a regulation win and avoids delusions general managers whose teams are well off of being a contender thinking they re only a couple pieces away from being put over the top because they finished only a few points behind a playoff team because two losses   a win  On top of that the playoff matchups would have switched up accordingly     EAST    A   Boston     pts   WC   New Jersey     pts    A   Tampa Bay     pts   A   Toronto     pts    M   Washington     pts   WC   Florida     pts    M   Pittsburgh     pts   M   Philadelphia     pts     WEST    C   Winnipeg     pts   WC   Colorado     pts    C   Nashville     pts   C   Minnesota     pts    P   Vegas     pts   WC   Los Angeles     pts    P   Anaheim     pts   P   San Jose     pts   So does anyone agree that this would make for a good switch for the NHL or are there any major flaws here that someone can point out which would make this not work ,New Point System I Experimented With,nhl

299,I don t the All Star games   I think they are gimmicky and see no real entertainment value  The skills competition can be somewhat interesting for me but the game portion  in my opinion  is a waste     However  I certainly understand the value of All Star weekends   They are events for the fans  They give greater access to the games rising and established stars and offer fans an opportunity to see the game s best enjoy some light spirited hockey  The entire premise is fan appreciation which is appropriate given the player s salaries are entirely dependant on the fans  Ticket sales  advertising  merchandise sales  and tv viewership are all avenues which make the NHL  teams  and players their money  With no fans in the stands or watching on TV there would be no professional hockey league    To that end  Ovechkin is skipping an event designed for the fans  Moreover  he decided to skip knowing and fully accepting the one game suspension from the league  which obviously indicates one game is neither a deterrent or a serious determining factor in his attendance   I don t like or watch the All Star weekend so I don t care whether or not he is there  but someone does     Some kid wants to see Ovi  some parent will need to explain it to their son or daughter that he isn t showing up  I think there should be a longer suspension  a fine  or the suspension of a meaningful game  like a playoff game  to have the players evaluate their participation   They are being paid because people like to watch hockey   I think there should be more accountability  ,Anyone think Ovechkin should get a harsher punishment for missing the All Star game ,nhl

305,This is my out there idea which is actually a re hash of the first all star game with a big twist for fans     The All Star game returns to the NHL All Stars vs Stanley Cup Champions with the Champions being the road team  thus still allowing the venue  and NHL jersey  to change every year   The game returns to a standard one off    minute   on   exhibition game    Here s the modern twist  To add depth to the Stanley Cup Champion  who presumably shouldn t need too much   the franchise can select up to    players from around the NHL to join their roster for the game  but with one caveat  The player must have played at least    regular season games for the team at some point in his career       Hence this years game rosters could be   All Stars   McDavid  Edmonton   Crosby  Pittsburgh   Kucherov  Tampa   Gaudreau  Calgary   Keller  Phoenix   Kane  Chicago   O Reilly  St  Louis   Barzal  NYI   Matthews  Toronto   Pastrnak  Boston   Eichel  Buffalo   Garnlund  Minnesota    Doughty  Los Angeles   Burns  San Jose   Jones  Columbus   Chabot  Ottawa   Yandle   Florida   Heiskanen  Dallas    Price  Montreal   Lunqvist  NYR   Rinne  Nashville    Washington Capitals   Backstrom  Ovechkin  Oshie  Wilson  Kuznetsov  Connolly  Eller  Vrana  Beagle  Vancouver   Johansson  New Jersey   Williams  Carolina   Perreault  Winnipeg   Carlson  Niskanen  Kempny  Orlov  Schmidt  Las Vegas   Green  Detroit   Holtby  Varlamov  Colorado   Neuvirth  Philadelphia     these rosters are for displays purposes only  feel free to hate on the format  hating on the selections is a waste of time  i just threw in as many names as possible as quickly as possible  Obviously everyone but the Champs only get one player  and  yeah  Arizona and Anaheim got screwed  but i also only used   of the    allotments allowed for the current champs    so i imagine the biggest problem with this plan is getting at least one player from every team    Please feel free to hate on the idea  Or improve one it  i really just want an All star game i feel like watching and my theory was this  The fans of the team that won the cup get the pleasure of seeing a few fellow players wear their jersey again    and everyone else hopefully will get to watch the rest of the NHL pummel that jersey mercilessly   Oh  and the Skills Competition would remain all stars vs ALL the champs  so the  marginal   but valuable players  like Devante Smith Pelly are still going to be a part of the festivities  ,Out There Idea for new All Star Format which builds on a classic format   ,nhl

327,I understand that NHL is based in USA and Canada  however even so I think the focus shouldn t be only on the Americans considering they lost  NHL still have fans from so many countries and not only North America  I ve seen NHL as neutral in questions like these  Even the picture is only of the  devasted Americans   none of the Finns cheering  NHL should be more neutral than that  shouldn t it  I am wondering if it could be because you can change the NHL website to your language if you want to  and this is maybe written as if only Americans and Canadians would read it and that perhaps Finns  Swedes and such would have a totally different article focusing on their players  Is that so  I haven t checked that  so I don t know  Even so  British fans for example would have this version to read  as well as others whose language don t exist on the NHL webpage    Am I wrong  Please  correct me in that case  this was just something that caught my eye  I hope you understand what I mean  I m not the best at explaining    Here s a link to the article    , USA devasted by loss to Finland  says the headline on the NHL s website about the finale of the WJC  Why do they have focus on the silver medalists instead of the gold medalists ,nhl

336,I was playing hockey the other night  a guy from  team A  takes a shot on net  the goalie makes a save and the puck goes straight up in the air  A second guy from the same team watches as the puck falls back towards the ice and then headbutts the puck into the net  soccer style  Is this a goal  It seems to me that it wouldn t be because it s not a deflection  It d be the same as kicking it  or batting it with your hand into the net  It shows clear intent to score  If someone could help me understand this it d be appreciated  Thx ,Need some help on the clarification of a certain rule ,nhl
337,So  I ll admit in newish to the game  fan for three years  only able to watch on TV regularly this year   I became a pens fan during their      Stanley Cup run because I was living in Pittsburgh  and the energy is contagious when you have a run like that  Because that was the season I came in on Murray was the player I kept an eye on   I know he s been injured this season  but the penguins had a terrible run while he was out and not       Suddenly  we re on an   game win streak with Murray including two shut outs and nothing below a      save record for those games  And now we put DeSmith in  who had a      the last game against the Blackhawks    Not to mention every time I see him play he looks so squirrelly  like he s not in control at all   So  help me understand  Why the hell do we keep taking Murray out when  it seems to me  he s clearly the better goalie ,Why do the Penguins keep starting DeSmith over Murray ,nhl

351,The guy used to be in my opinion  the worst GM in the entire league  He had some many bad or questionable moves that didn t help the team at all and were stuck in mindset where all their hope was on Carey Price and Max Pacioretty and had very few promising prospects in the pipeline  His job was certainly on the line but I have to give him credit  he has done a complete     and has turned around the organization to an extent  not fully but it s getting there   Drouin  Domi and Tatar have exceeded expectations  their prospects had a good showing at the World Juniors and their in the playoff picture  And with Bergevin stating they won t look to buy rental players and sell future assets  shows that his veteran vote of confidence is starting to slip away ,Marc Bergevin,nhl

290,Hey everyone  I was watching some games from      with the flyers and bruins respectively  and boy that was some good old hockey being played in those games  With the new NHL witch is based on speed and finesse  the big hits and physical play seems to have taken a backseat  I ve looked around and did some research as of what playing style people prefer  And my conclusion is that the league has gotten soft  You bring in kids now that will rather deke or dangle around you than hit you  The fights is all but gone from the game entirely and players seems to get smaller by the minute  We need to get some toughness back in the league  Bring up some  th liners who brings energy but can also drop the gloves  Just keep it clean  No headshots and shit like that  The rivalries will eventually die out if the physical play stops  And we have some great rivalries in the league  This is just my opinion  What do u guys think   But it s still the best game on earth BTW  ,The new NHL,nhl

324,Like they just play   on   until the next whistle  Makes the most sense to me so possibly a dumb question that I already knew the answer to but now my brain wont let it go   If that s the case how are line changes managed after  They just do a typical change and make sure the fighting player comes off  Or the fighter stays on the ice  because what if the other team doesn t change and play keeps going    Or when they get back on the ice are they both just supposed to skate to the bench  Or do they stay in the box until first whistle after ,Ok Google is pissing me off and cant answer my question no matter how I phrase or limit it    is it   on   after players return from a fight ,nhl

331,The expansion teams are some of my favorites to watch  so I ranked each expansion relocated team s success  all that happened since the start of the   s   Since dynamics often change drastically with a move  I ve separated teams like the Thrashers and Jets   In order from worst to best   Atlanta Thrashers  when you have to relocate to a different city just    years after inception  that s just   not good  Florida Panthers  look  I get they had an amazing run in the   s to the SC  but if you add together the whole picture you get a factory of misery  Columbus Blue Jackets  this decade has been much better than the previous  but they re the only team still seeking a playoff series win and have still sucked for the majority of their existence  Arizona Coyotes  the NHLs  wonderful  desert experiment has gone as expected outside of one sick run to the WCF in       their only ever playoff series wins   Winnipeg Jets  this one s got the biggest potential to change for the better  but a mostly lackluster           still hurts  at least the hockey improved from Atlanta   Minnesota Wild  we re getting into average territory now  The Wild have had good years  but I docked several points for being first and second round punching bags  outside of       and being a significant downgrade from the North Stars  Nashville Predators  more or less the same as the Wild being first and second round punching bags  though their      SC run puts them just ahead of Minnesota  Ottawa Senators  probably the most average team on this list  They ve always been the good  sometimes great but not excellent enough team       was sort of an exception  but they got bounced pretty easily by the Ducks  San Jose Sharks  very frequent trips to the playoffs and a nice      SC run  They re great in the regular season  but I must say as an honest Sharks fan that this team handles adversity the worst of any team in the NHL  They re one of the worst teams when trailing by   or more goals and possibly the most uninspired in elimination games  Did you know that in      against the Hurricanes they had their first   goal regular season comeback ever  Just proving my point that this team literally just gives up when things get just a little more difficult from them  case and point  watch the last   years when they were eliminated in a Game     OK  my rant is over   Carolina Hurricanes  entering cup territory now  Really enjoyed this team s      championship  sadly other than some sporadic success in other years this team has really been quite mediocre  Tampa Bay Lightning  things have really looked up in recent years thanks to Yzerman  and who can forget their      win  However  the Lightning still have a low overall win loss percentage  Dallas Stars  This team was super good in the beginning with guys like Hull and Modano       SC win   then became average  and now are struggling like hell  The good old days keeps them this high up  Colorado Avalanche  the best relocated team in this bunch  Very fun to watch in the beginning  with guys like Roy and Sakic doing amazing things and winning two SCs for Denver  They re getting better again but since      it s been mostly crappy  getting better again though    Anaheim Ducks  the most consistently good team in the bunch over the years IMO  You gotta give it to them as an expansion franchise  They also have the highest win loss record of any franchise on this list   And what about the Vegas Golden Knights  Honestly  I m not too optimistic they can maintain their initial success  Their grade is incomplete for now  but if you re like me  their initial run was more of a hot streak than actual substance  I can only hope for Vegas fans that they don t catch Florida Panther syndrome and experience endless mediocrity from here on out ,Expansion Relocated team success since the   s,nhl

334,I ve always enjoyed Olympic hockey  but being from Oklahoma I ve never really been able to get into hockey  Warm weather and attention to other sports has kept me away  Buuuut this year I ve decided not to get NBA league pass and instead jump into hockey  The NBA has frankly become boring  I ll still root for my Thunder  but other games have turned sour for me  everyone knows whats going to happen  the Warriors are gonna fool around and win    games  and then beat the living crap out of everyone in the playoffs and win again  It s like skipping to the end of a book  just kinda ruins the season for me  So I need something to fill the void   As such I ve decided now is as good a time as any to make a leap into ice sport  knowing next to nothing about the teams or the league  I figure there s a league pass alternative that I can get as well    Here is where I need y all s help  I figure watching and keeping up with the whole league would be ridiculous and overwhelming for an unfrosted newbie  So I need to narrow my fandom down to a single team  I ll go ahead and put out   vetoes  no Dallas  and no Chicago  But everyone else is on the menu  Plucky gritty  great fans  sweet sweaters  right    are definitely selling points  I m for sure looking to get some merch and to watch a game in person this year  Anyway  thanks in advance for any suggestions   Sincerely  a sunburnt looking to be frostbit potential fan ,Trying to get the into NHL  Need Help Picking a Team,nhl

176,Gary Bettman who is the commissioner of the National Hockey League  NHL  was brought in    years ago with one agenda  and that was to grow the game of hockey in the USA   In Canada the game of hockey is like a religion  with winters lasting   months all there is  is hockey   Fans are passionate and it s the number one sport   Football and baseball come second and third   Unfortunately for fans in Canada  no Canadian NHL team has won the Stanley Cup for    years since the Montreal Canadians have won   This thesis will explain why no Canadian team will win the Stanley Cup until at least        Gary Batman s job is to grow the game in the USA  there are currently    NHL teams in the USA and   in Canada  With expansion more and more teams have started in American cities  Ice hockey teams in Florida  Panthers and Lightning   in the desert with Phoenix and Las Vega  other warm places such as Dallas  LA  Anaheim  San Jose   these are warm climate cities who now have ice rinks   The people there don t really care about hockey  they are more interested in football  basketball and baseball  yet they have ice hockey teams   Why  because Gary Bettman wants them there  because that s his    mission  grow the game in the USA   The NHL is a billion dollar industry and with the USA population being    times larger then the Canadian population the potential for money revenue is greater in the USA even though the interest is not there   Now with the weaning attendance in places like Florida and Phoenix  how do you attract more fans   By having winning teams  nobody is going to go see a loser team if they don t really want to see a game in the first place   So you have to create attraction  excitement  what better way then by winning  making the playoffs and winning the ultimate trophy  the Stanley Cup   Now in Canada people will watch hockey no matter what   In Toronto people will pay      per seat for a team that has not won a Stanley Cup in    years     yet every night the arena is sold out   You don t need to win  people will still come  they have for    years   In      we had the chance to see the Montreal Canadians and the Toronto Maple Leafs play in the final for the Stanley Cup  now this would have been a huge loss of revenue in the USA as why would the Americans care about two Canadian teams   Wayne Gretzky was still fresh in LA  the game was being grown in the LA market  with celebrities  Hollywood  billions of dollars on the line   So what happened  in the last   minutes of the game between LA and Toronto   Wayne Gretzky high sticked a Toronto player Doug Gilmour in the face  there was a cut  there was blood  in the rules that s a   minute automatic penalty  but guess what it was never called   the game ended up going into overtime and Gretzky scored the overtime winner and LA magically went on into the finals to play for the Cup   This would also be the last year a Canadian team won the Stanley Cup   Now you might say how can the NHL control the outcome of games  simple answer  the referees work for the NHL  they control the penalties  goals called back  they are the judges of the games   They can influence a game in any direction they choose   Take the      Stanley Cup finals between Dallas and Buffalo  all season that year the rule was if any part of an offensive player is in the blue ice of the goalie crease when the puck goes into the net  the goal will be disallowed for obstruction of the goalie      goals were called back in      playoffs because someone s skate was in the crease  even if it was just a skate lace in the crease  no goal   Yet the famous Stanley Cup winning goal scored by Brett Hull from Dallas that year clearly shows his whole leg in the crease while he is shoveling the puck into the net to win the cup   The goal should have been disallowed as per the rules  yet it stood and Dallas won the cup   The Stars coincidentally just moved to Dallas from Minnesota   years earlier and nobody was watching their games in hot Dallas  so what better way to attract new fans than by winning the Stanley Cup   And who decided that  the NHL  through their referees who let the goal stand that should have been disallowed   Canada has had   of their   teams in the Stanley Cup finals in the last    years yet none of them have won the cup        Calgary vs Tampa  yep Tampa won       Edmonton vs Carolina  yep Carolina won       Ottawa vs  Anaheim   yep Anaheim won       Vancouver vs Boston   yep  Boston won  In           season  no Canadian team even made the playoffs   The game still has a lot of growing in the USA  and Gary will make sure those teams are winning the Stanley Cups south of the border with Canada   And he has his referees to make sure it happens   Incidentally I predict that Las Vegas will win the Stanley Cup in the next   years  I know it s the desert  who cares about ice and hockey  is there even an arena in Las Vegas   But imagine the excitement of a Stanley Cup final right there in Vegas   all the celebrities can fly down from Hollywood  you have the casinos and the main event  just like when they hold the boxing matches there   I can just see the dollar signs spinning in Gary Bettman s eyes   Way to go Gary    years with no Cup in Canada and    more to go   Sorry Canadian citizens and fans  after all the NHL is a billion dollar business  it s all about the money  but keep cheering maybe this year Winnipeg might have a shot  not   they will be out by round   like the Leafs  ,Why no Canadian NHL team will win the Stanley Cup  here is why,nhl

184,Four years ago after the Canucks disappointing loss to the Flames I had finally reached my limit of waiting  hoping and praying for the Canucks to win a Stanley Cup   After    years of waiting I have finally had enough   I packed away my   hockey jerseys    hats  tire cover    flags and   blankets into a box and said this is enough waiting   I do not want to be one of those fans that waits their whole life to see their team try to win the ultimate prize   Life is too short for that   You can only hear   we are rebuilding  so many times in your lifetime   I have already dedicated    years to this team   I did not want to be like a Leafs fan who is waiting for    years for their team to even reach the finals or how about a Chicago Cubs fan  there was not one alive who had seen them win a World Series  it s was     years for them       Nope I wasn t going to be one of those fans who gets swayed by the media and the hype to cheer on their team every start of the season   hockey is a business and as long as fans come and pay and watch and buy the        beers and pay      for a pair of platinum seats the hype will be there   Unfortunately for me I couldn t justify watching a losing team for those kind of prices and hype     Simple math will show us that the Canucks will not win a Stanley Cup until      possibly   First Stanley Cup appearance                    years waiting Second Stanley Cup appearance                  years waiting Third Stanley Cup appearance                    years waiting Possible Fourth appearance                      years waiting  I m sorry but I m not willing to wait until      to maybe see the Canucks win the Stanley Cup   I will not be a Chicago Cubs fan who had to wait for     years   I m an athlete myself and a competitor and I play to win and not just to have fun and I expect my hockey team to win also  unfortunately    years without winning was too long to wait   So this was my official good bye letter to Vancouver management  Trevor Linden and everyone else in Canucks Nation  I was not going to be a loser fan like a Leafs  Cleveland Indians or a Cubs fans who waited for     years   I didn t follow hockey for   years  I had no team  but I missed the game  I play   times a week and wanted to have a team to cheer for   So when I heard that Las Vegas was getting an NHL team  I immediately decided that this would be my favorite team for life now   I flew down the first week of the season  watched   games  loved it  got a new Vegas jersey and hat  license plate cover and I didn t care if the team didn t do well in their inaugural season  well to my excitement they went all the way to the Stanley Cup Finals    So I have no regrets switching teams  incidentally the Vancouver Canucks have only gotten worse the last   years   Sometimes change is good  also no Canadian team is going to win the Cup for another    years so I m glad I fired my old team   I fired my team and I have no regrets    Golden Knights fan for life    championssoon  ,I FIRED my favorite NHL team and I have no regrets ,nhl

447,Not to be confused with average time on ice  I needed to know who has the most time on ice  period  Who has spent the most time playing NHL hockey   First  the methodology  This will be a highly contested stat  since some great players started playing before TOI and ATOI was tracked in the begining of the       season  Therefore  out of respect for the greats that came before the stat  this will be limited to active players  Playoffs included  exhibition excluded  Let s begin   First  an honorable mention  With his NHL career nearing it s end  and future uncertain  Jaromir Jagr is getting royally screwed in this stat  Having played   full seasons since the start of toi  he s left with           minutes of documented time on ice  Although that may seem impressive  it does not break the top    He may  just may  have the most time on ice among active players  if he is indeed still active  but far too much uncertainty comes with estimating   seasons of gameplay  Giving him the benefit of the doubt  let s add number of games  career atoi      games       per game            bringing his total to           If true  Jagr would solidly park his ass in second place  Unfortunately  there is no way of knowing  therefore he gets an honorable mention for being a hardcore dinosaur that forgot more about hockey than most fans will ever know   At number    With           minutes of game play   Jay Bouwmeester has racked up quite a few minutes in his    year career  His impressive atoi of       is the highest among the top   in this list  as well as his career        If the leader retired now  he would have to play that average time for another     games to catch the number one player   Number    Jerome Iginla is currently an unempoloyed nhl player that has amassed           documented minutes  plus   undocumented season in which he played    games  Unfortunately  that season would have to have been played by jerome in it s entirety  plus all    playoff games that would have to go to triple ot to be a contender for the number one spot   Number    With    years with the sharks  toronto center Patrick Marleau has earned           minutes of ice time  earning the second most playoff minutes in this list  Considdering he spent   years with the sharks  it s impressive his    year old body has any cartilage left to pklay the game with   At number    At     the bear turned shark probably has beard hair older than you  Joe Thorton has amassed            minutes        points  and a      rating in his    year career  He is a rock steady player that can snipe with the best of them and grind with the worst of them  But even though he looks like father time  he may need a time machine to make up the       minute deficit that separates him from the number   slot   And then there was big Z  With a clock shattering           minutes ice time  he is far ahead of the league in documented time on ice  To put it in perspective  if you were to watch every time he stepped on the ice back to back  you would be up for almost    days straight  His time on ice is long enough to watch the entire M  A  S  H   tv series  including the   hour finally  with commercials    times over  He has logged          playoff minutes  also the most on this list  The     bear may very well be in his last season  but it will be a while before his impact on the leage will heal  In a hillarious twist of irony  he is the captain of rookie Jake debrusk  the son of louie Debrusk  who faught chara on the ice in the   s  Must have been a little awkward in that locker room the first time they met   Love him or hate him  there s no denying he is the most experienced guy on the ice   This was a lot of fun to write and research  and I hope nobody get s their panties in a bunch over the numbers  it s all in fun   Source    ,offseason boredom  Career Time On Ice Leader since the stat was tracked  Among active players,nhl
467,So I m a super new fan to the hockey  I decided to give it a go for the Capitals vs  Lightning game  and I was kinda immediately hooked  Like  oh man  this is all just fantastic  I love it  and I m gonna go and see some local hockey pretty soon             is going to be my first full season  and as it stands right now I ve actually only accidentally seen Capitals games  I m fine with that  I like them  I love how they play  it s super exciting  but I just don t want to head into a new season with that kinda bias in my head  y know  I wanna end up picking a team to support naturally   So before then  I m going to go back and watch at least one game of every team s  Are there any stand out performances that a team put on this year that I should go and watch in particular  Like  really special showings that they managed to put on during last season that really showed the best that team can do  Seems like the best way to have some context for each team going into next season ,Newbie wants to do some catching up,nhl

51,It s insane how toxic the community is getting all because a team from my home town is finding success in it s inaugural season  Born and raised here in Vegas and it blows my mind how rude the NHL community is being on social media  All I have is Reddit and Instagram but every post is met with such hostility  It really saddens me that they want to take away so much joy from this historic season  Im proud of this team and am happy to be a fan  We get so much hate because of it and it s sad because I love that the NHL now reaches a whole new fanbase in this hometown of mine and abroad  You don t have to be from here to be a fan  You might not have a hometown team  I haven t had one for    years and boy does it feel great to finally have one  Even though everyone else wants to say it s handed to us or refs in our pocket etc  I see the same exuses all the time trying to take away from what this team has done  Nobody saw them being in the position they re in right now and because they re there we re bandwagons  know nothing about hockey or haven t earned it as a franchise  So if this is your team welcome  we re all misfits here  That is all  ,Why the hate ,nhl
55,I started watching hockey as a Flyers fan because I m from the area  It s hard not to be a fan of the home team around you when it s constantly shoved down your throat    I remember when my friend first told me that Las Vegas would be having a hockey team  I thought it was kind of odd  but really neat at the same time  When I first heard the name I thought  huh    I would have guessed they d go with something more desert ish like the Scorpions      Throughout the year I kept hearing about the Las Vegas Golden Knights in my peripheral Flyers vision  Eventually the time came where these two teams would meet  Flyers visited Vegas for their first contest shortly after Philadelphia won the super bowl  I watched this game on TV and remember there being so many Flyers fans in the stands  When the Flyers scored it almost seemed like the cheers were louder for them than Vegas  At one point you could even hear the crowd chanting  E A G L E S EAGLES   My fianc  and I watch hockey together and I told her I had enjoyed hearing about Vegas and thought it was really great how well they re doing for a first year team  When the Flyers and Vegas met a second time  this time in Philadelphia  and the Flyers lost  she said to me  your team won   And I laughed along with her over her humor   The next chance I had to watch the Golden Knights was game two of round two against the Sharks  and it was this game when I really fell in love with this team  The energy from watching them on TV alone is incredible  Their pregame shows are really fun to see  The fans in the stands wearing all kinds of fun costumes add a lot of personality to it  Keep in mind that the Knights lost this game that I watched   If all of this makes me a bandwagon fan  then I can only assume that anybody who thinks so is only salty that their team has never gotten this far or has had as good of a chance as the Knights do right now in their team s entire history   It s great to see Fleury doing so incredibly well and having so much fun  It s awesome to see the Knights defy all predictions round after round  game after game  It s great for a first year team to give their fans and new fans elsewhere something to cheer for    I don t know what s going to happen next year  but I will still be a Knights fan if they make it as far or not next season  But in the meantime  I m going to continue to enjoy watching them do what they ve been doing all year long and hope that we get to see some neat history and watch them hoist the Stanley Cup in a few weeks  ,Here s why I m a fan of the Golden Knights ,nhl

139,So I went to the game last night and before the Capitals scored their first goal  they took a shot and hit the post    however the stadium rang the buzzer and froze all the logos around the stadium acting like it was a goal  They kept everything that way for a couple of seconds like play continued    and they clearly rattled the lightning players  train of thought with the fake goal since they scored like three seconds later   and it was obvious that it had an effect      So  my question is are stadiums allowed to do this fake goal stuff    I believe at that point play should be frozen and players allowed to regroup mentally   instead of turning around and believing they had just been scored on and then having to continue to fight off an attack    Seemed kind of sketch to me to say the least ,Washington Capitals Fake Goal Last Night,nhl

147,Man  I wish Kerry Fraser was still doing his column on TSN but I can t understand why the referee waved off icing on the second goal    To be fair  I think it was the correct and appropriate call based on so called  good hockey  but I also believe it was      against the rules        Icing         gt  If the race for the puck is too close to determine by the time the first player reaches the end zone face off dots    icing shall be called           No Icing        gt  If  in the opinion of the Linesman  any player  other than the goalkeeper  of the opposing team is able to play the puck before it passes his goal line  but has not done so  play shall continue and the icing violation shall not be called   I am guessing      was the rule actually called but if you look the replay here            Braydon Coburn  TB  has no chance of catching the puck  the puck is clearly going to cross the line  neither player has made it to the dot  and Stephenson  WSH  is obviously hot on his ass    So this seems like        icing and  not        Therefor no goal   BS aside  I hope Ovi wins    ,Why wasn t the Capitals called for icing on the second goal   game   ,nhl

272,I wrote   parts  as of yet  of different business lessons to take from the Golden Knights success   Since the LinkedIn community seems to appreciate I thought I d share here  here s an executive summary   Loss aversion is an important concept in behavioural economics that essentially states that humans feel something the pain of a loss twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining  You can read more about loss aversion here   The important distinction is that the Knights were able to make deals with other teams before the expansion draft that would allow teams to designate the player taken from them  This is where the concept of loss aversion plays a factor because the Golden Knights  success can be largely attributed to the deals that were made during this time period,Business Lessons from the Golden Knights   loss aversion and competitive advantage,nhl

28,As an Islander fan and a division rival of the devils I have been cheering for the them in the      stanley cup playoffs  I watched all the games so far  tampa has had so many penalties it s horrible  In the regular season Tampa was   th in penalty killing which for cup contending team that takes penalties often is Horrible  For the devils their power play is pretty good and are   th at the end of the season  With tampa s urge to take penalties the devils will score more power play goals even tho they only have   goals they can still tire out tampa with drawing penalties and then start scoring  Tho Tampa has too superstars Stamkos and Kucherov and young underrated players they are definitely a favorite for the stanley cup but with the devils that have mixed with young and veteran players the younger players can learn from the veterans and have good chemistry  For example Taylor hall and Nico hischier on the same line Taylor can teach the young rookie tips about being in the nhl and they could have a good relationship  Just like Stamkos and kucherov but without the rookie part  The devils will obviously win in   games  The reason they will win is from tyring tampa out  In game one the devils were losing but tired tampa out so much that tampa looked like walruses on ice  As long as the devils have strong goaltending during the remaining games they can take them out  This is why I think they will beat tampa in the first round  This is a prediction   Don t mind some minor mistakes i m only in the  th grade ,Why the devils will beat Tampa ,nhl

180,Sorry if this is dumb question  but I just thought of it and couldn t remember what happens   Take this scenario for example   A team is down   with    seconds left in the game   They have possession of the puck  have pulled their goalie  and enter the offensive zone   Although it wasn t called  a player was offiside on entry   They maintain puck possession and the zone for    seconds and score at the last second   The goal is challenged and it s determined they were offsides  The goal does not count and the game restarts with a faceoff in the neutral zone   Clearly the clock management is important here   The offsides not being called when it should have put the team in a position  unknown to them  where nothing they do matters until they either exit and reenter the zone or score and have it not count     nd question   Can coaches challenge overtime game winners just like any other goal  or does the challenge have to come from somewhere else  much like booth review in the last   minutes of football    The normal consequences for failed challenges    min DOG or loss of time out  obviously have no bearing in this situation   Thanks ,Does time get added back to the clock if a goal is overturned for offsides  Also  are there any limitations on challenging an overtime goal ,nhl

218,Can t wait to tell my kids about how this monster ruined the organization    We were a few years removed from a cup run and the organization began to stall  So we hired a hotshot GM and flyer legend to lead us back to dominance  The first year was tough  but with the hiring of a new up and coming coach  there was plenty of optimism  However  it quickly became obvious that the new coach was a dud who couldn t handle the locker room or the intricacies of the pro game    pathetic  st round playoff losses later and the city is calling for his head  However  our legend GM wouldn t fire him  said he still deserves time to build his culture  Thus begun the darkest time of the flyers history  Countless ahl players lined the roster sprinkled with promising  yet unused talent as the flyers dwelled in the basement of the metro for   years without a playoff appearance  All while our GM claimed it was all part of the rebuild and that Hakstol would eventually build a winning culture with the young guys  Eventually  after the fans finally realized that it wasn t Hakstols fault  but the GM s  the media began to turn on him  At a press conference following a pathetic    point season  one reporter finally asked what was on everyone s mind   what do you think this team needs in order to seriously compete  Because it s obvious that Hakstol and his game don t translate to the nhl and the fans are getting restless   The GM took a moment to pause and think  and responded   we need about tree fiddy    It was about then that the media and fans began to put together the pieces and notice that this former flyer legend and GM was about   stories tall and was a crustacean from the Mesozoic era   Damned monster ruined the organization for almost a decade for tree fiddy  Almost gave it to him too ,Thoughts on the flyers and Hextall s legacy,nhl

25,The Predators just beat the Sabres in Buffalo  AGAIN  So I did a little more research and I came across these mind boggling stats   Don t talk about home ice advantage to the Wild or Predators when they re in Buffalo  The Wild own an       points winning percentage over the Sabres in Buffalo        overall   It s even worse with the Preds  including the aforementioned game  they own an       winning points percentage over the Sabres in Buffalo         overall  seriously you only have   home victory in your lifetime over the Predators of all teams       There are   head to head records where the home team holds less than a     winning points percentage  In case you haven t figured it out yet  the Sabres dubiously hold both of those head to head records   On that note  the Sabres must see Ryan Suter in their nightmares too  that overpaid sucker has a     record in Buffalo  He has only played for the Predators and Wild in his career  so I guess that makes sense ,Random Fact  Wild and Predators dominate Sabres in Buffalo,nhl
26,So while doing research for my previous post about the Sabres misfortunes against the Wild and the Predators at home  I came across this mind boggling stat   The Avalanche have not been too great as of recent  That doesn t mean they don t get to feast upon some teams sometimes  Or  in the case of Boston  for years upon years upon years   The last time the Bruins beat the Avalanche on home ice was March           That is not a typo  The Bruins have a streak surrendering points on home ice against the Avs that began before the turn of the millennium  That s the kind of stuff you see in college sports  not professional hockey   To be fair  there was a tie in       But a tie ain t a win   To add more salt to the wound  most of those losses were close ones  By close  I mean the only loss by more than   goals was actually this years matchup  when the Avalanche destroyed the Bruins     in Boston  Most of those games follow familiar storylines  the Bruins fell into a big hole in the beginning and couldn t complete the comeback  the Bruins lost a close battle between the pipes  the Bruins squandered a   goal lead  the Bruins lost on a buzzer beater by Daniel Briere  that last one is unique  but no less soul crushing    On that note  this is one of only two such head to head streaks I found dating before       and the only one that involves a road team beating the home team  as I said  this is the stuff of college sports  not professional hockey   The other one  Philadelphia s    game regular season home winning streak against Chicago since       has a huge asterisk next to it since the Blackhawks crushed Philadelphia s soul by winning Game   of the      Stanley Cup on Flyer ice  That technically doesn t count against the regular season head to head record because it was a playoff victory  but it does show that given the right circumstances  teams can exorcise their head to head record demons   Perhaps the Bruins and Avalanche should meet in the SC Finals one year  Maybe the Bruins  if pushed hard enough  will finally win a home game against the Avs ,Random Fact  Bruins buried by Avalanche on home ice,nhl

60,  What is a game blackout    A blackout is when a game will not be available for streaming live in the NHL streaming service  The users will have to wait until the replay is available on the service to watch that particular match and according to the NHL website that can take up to   hrs after the match took place    amp nbsp     What causes a blackout on the NHL Live streaming service    The reason way a match will be in blackout in the NHL streaming service is because the transmission rights were sold to a TV broadcaster  they call this matches  in market games   When the broadcaster buys games from the NHL it s included in the deal that the NHL does Not stream them in their service so people watch the broadcaster s transmission instead  Unfortunately most local broadcasters buy most of the games of their local team so users that live where their favorite team is will not be able to watch most of the games using the NHL streaming service because of this   This effect can be as small as the county where the team is or as big as the whole state affecting multiple teams  Most of the live games will be exclusively on TV in one of the local TV Stations for free or through a paying TV provider    amp nbsp     When you say  most of the games  exactly how many do you mean    It varies per team but for example in the           season    out of the    RedWings regular season matches were sold to TV broadcaster    amp nbsp     I m in a different state than my favorite team  am I on the clear    No  There are also  National Broadcasters  that buy games off the NHL extending the stream blackout to the entire country  This are way less than the local blackout games and it varies greatly per team based on their popularity but to get a notion of how many national blackouts might take place in a season in the           season the team with the most national blackouts is Chicago with    out of the    regular season games    amp nbsp     How can I tell if my local team is subject to blackouts    The NHL provides the blackout detector tool where based on your zip code it will tell which teams in the region have in market games that season       amp nbsp     Does this affect the playoffs and the Stanly Cup Championship games    Yes it does    amp nbsp     I m not in the U S nor Canada  am I in the clear    Yes  If the NHL streaming service is available in your country and with some exceptions like the UK were a TV Broadcaster there buys a dozen or so of games from the NHL per season    amp nbsp     Is there a way to know in advance what games will be under the blackout status    Yes  The NHL website provides a Broadcasting schedule of the entire season moving forward here   amp nbsp     amp nbsp   If they have a broadcaster under  Network  that means most likely the match will not be available to stream live at a local and or national level depending on the broadcaster who bought it  National Blackout   The ones with a logo of the broadcaster i e MSNBC  NHL Network  Local Blackout   The ones with the letters of the broadcaster in plane text    amp nbsp     Does the NHL disclaims this    Currently their advertise phrases the streaming service as  Watch out of market games LIVE  and full archives on demand   and have a blackout information section on the bottom of the NHL TV subscription page     amp nbsp     So what should I expect from the NHL Live streaming service    If you live in the same region than your favorite team there is a big chance you won t be able to watch most of their games live using the streaming service  You re going to have to rely on the local TV broadcast either for free or through a paying TV provider depending on who bought the game  If you live far away from your favorite team then you will be able to watch most of the games live using the streaming service with an occasional national blackout or the local blackout of the team they are playing if it affects your area  If you live outside the U S Canada and the streaming service is available in your Country you ll be able to watch every game live  Regardless of where you live however you ll be able to access the game replays once there available and the rest of the off line content    amp nbsp     Do the other sport leagues do this    Yes  Currently some examples are   amp nbsp    NBA  The NBA does not sell matches to the local market so only national blackouts affect their stream so you will be able to watch about     of the season         month or        year  amp nbsp    NFL  The NFL sells every game to the market so currently none of the regular season is available to stream live in their service  However the subscription will give you live access to the post season including the Super Bowl         month   amp nbsp    MLB  Same as the NHL service  The whole season is subject to local and national blackouts including the postseason         month or         year   amp nbsp   NOTE  This information can change at any day  The information is what was available at the moment of the post publication    amp nbsp     Is there a way I can work around the blackouts    Yes  Now days there are various services online called  VPN  or  DNS  services that for a monthly fee they will rent out a server that is located in an area of the world that is not being affected by the blackouts   The way it works in simple terms is that they instruct you on how to change certain settings on your device so that it can connect to their server which connects to the streaming game for you and sends the signal back to your device  Some streaming services not only the sports ones are working on detecting this so it is unknown how long this type of solution will last     amp nbsp       SOURCES

75,   For those of you who follow Bleacher Report  which I m guessing is not a lot of NHL fans  the only posts about NHL they upload are anything that has to do with Sidney Crosby making an amazing play  I m certain that you can ask anyone at B R s social media staff and they can t name   NHL players  Matt Benning did something  way more impressive    the other night and nobody took notice  Just a little flyers NHL fan rant  ,This is how Bleacher Report pisses me off     rant ,nhl

83,I was wondering if one of you computer savvy people would be kind enough to direct me to somewhere showing this year s standings with alternate point values  Or if someone is feeling generous to type up their own list or what have you showing them  I would do it myself but I m not sure how to find information showing games that didn t need decided with any overtime  I m specifically interested in the       format    for a regulation win   for overtime shootout win   for overtime shootout loss   Any help is appreciated ,Standings with alternate point system ,nhl

109,Quite a few times ive seen it  Atacking team has   skaters on ice  trying to even the game in last minute  Then they ice the puck  and face off come back to team who had   skaters  But when actual face off happening goalie is back in the net  and only   skaters on ice  I always was under impression that when team ices the puck players stay on ice  Is the goalie exempt from the rule and can be swapped during icing call ,Icing  Are goalies exempt from the rule ,nhl
112,The Edmonton Oilers may have been the laughingstock of the league for quite sometime  but Carey Price may want to think twice before chipping his Edmonton joke in   It s been covered by several news outlets already  but Price s  failures against the Oilers are truly unfathomable  He owns a       record  a      SV   and a      GAA against Edmonton  Coaches have even decided to sit Price in previous Montreal Edmonton games   Price is an incredible goalie when healthy  and normally I would say such unusual statistical horrors are best left unexplained  However  Price has actually played decently against the Oilers in March  with both of his wins against the Oilers coming in that month  If I had to take a shot at it  I think it might be an issue with complacency  After all  it s not like the Oilers are going to stop being the Oilers  or the Canadiens are going to stop being the Canadiens  due to one loss in October or even February  well  hopefully Geoff Molson and Marc Bergevin haven t completely wrecked the Canadiens at this point haha   But come March  when playoff standings begin being written in stone  that s when every game matters  Even one against the lowly Oilers   Take last season  when Price put on his best performance against the Oilers in a     victory at Edmonton  This was a March game with heavy implications  and keep in mind this was against the best Oilers team we have seen in a very long time   This  or the fact the Canadiens and Oilers don t see each other very much  Carey Price has statistically performed worse against teams from the Western Conference and perhaps the Oilers just happen to be the worst of the bunch  It s understandable that you would perform worse against teams you have less experience against  but       against the Oilers is still pretty bad   Interestingly  there were trade rumors that Price was gonna be traded to Edmonton earlier this season  While speculative  that certainly is one way to purge someone s statistical demons   Injuries have held him back as of recent  but here s to hoping that Price returns to form and lives up to his massive contract extension that kicks in next year  I m confident he can and that   or   bad games against the Oilers each year won t have much effect on his legacy as a great goaltender ,Random Fact  Carey Price drowned by oil,nhl

228,Not necessarily the top    from this year  but more of a projection of their careers  Here s my list  in no particular order     Brock Boeser   Natural goal scorer  In every one of the three games I ve seen him in  he s scored  Should probably get used to that     Mathew Barzal   It s gonna be fun watching him over the next decade plus  Possession skills are up there with the best of them     Clayton Keller   Ditto with what I said about Barzal  I remember an OT game against the flyers earlier in the year where he had the puck on his stick for what felt like   of the   minutes of the OT period       Charlie McAvoy   If I could have any young defenseman in the league it d be this guy  minus the Columbus pair   Everything he does looks so    natural  Reminds me a little of Erik Karlsson     Nico Hischier   I didn t know anything about him to start the year admittedly  other than this is the guy taken over Patrick  Well  I can see why      Nolan Patrick   Has had his rough patches this year but no question the talent is there  Add in the physical presence he brings and grittiness on the poke check  He s the type of guy that will have a timid rookie year by all accounts then all of a sudden bring the hammer and a    goal season in year two      Pierre Luc Dubois   Already a refined two way player  Maybe not as high of a ceiling in terms of scoring as some others on this list  but a great prospect with a long career ahead of him      Alex DeBrincat   Only watched one Blackhawks game this year but he just so happened to score a hat trick  So yeah      Tyson Jost   Two things I notice watching the Avs this year     Holy shit has McKinnon always been this dominant     Jost has some serious agility  skating ability  and stick skills  Looks to be a playmaker for years to come      Mikhail Sergachev   This last spot was the toughest  Don t get me wrong Sergachev looks great  But everytime I ve watched TB it feels like he doesn t play that much  or maybe as much as he should  Also I ve noticed he s usually never out there against the top lines  which I guess if you had TB s defensive depth why would you  Certainly a top tier talent  and will probably be a first pair defenseman in the not too distant future   Honorable Mentions  Travis Sanheim  Danton Heinen  Alex Kerfoot  Yanni Gourde  Jesper Bratt  Will Butcher   Note  Some players played last year and I decided were ineligible for the list  such as Kyle Conner and Joel Eriksson Ek   Any else worth mentioning ,     Rookies that will have the most impactful careers ,nhl

424,So  with the Avalanche vs Blues game tonight  we basically have a wild card game in the NHL  It would seem simple enough that whoever wins the game gets the  nd wildcard spot  but it s the NHL  so it has to be made    times more confusing    After a series of tiebreakers  basically the result is that the Blues can clinch a spot with a single point  due to the season series tiebreaker they hold over the Avs  Which means the avalanche would need to get a regulation win  which would give them more points and put them in a playoff spot  If the game does go into OT  and the Avs win  it wouldn t matter  they would both have    points  both have    ROW  but the blues would get the advantage because they would have a       record opposed to the Avs       record against each other   Which leads me to an interesting scenario I thought of  Imagine if the game is tied late in the  rd  the Avs need a regulation win to make the playoffs   Does that mean the Avs would need to pull their goalie in a tie game to try to make a playoff spot  I m not sure if this has ever happened before in the NHL  where a goalie was pulled in a tie game due to crazy scenarios  but there is definitely a chance that it can happen tonight  If it has happened in a NHL game before  please tell me  but we can really see something crazy go down tonight  ,A Crazy Scenario That Can Happen Tonight Between the Blues and Avs,nhl

494,You could say I m pretty new to the league as I only started really following the sport on this level after my old schoolmate Puljuj rvi and the  new Finnish flash  Laine  and of course Matthews  started getting seemingly all the headlines    So my question is  have players like Laine and Matthews just been so good all the time to not have been sent down to the AHL  Or is it just that their teams needed what they can offer so bad all the time  Also  some players struggle hard before they eventually break into the NHL roster and that s normal  but at what point can you really call a  say  top    pick a bust ,Has Laine been NHL worthy since his first game ,nhl
496,Lets see em   West  Nashville over Colorado in   Winnipeg over Minnesota in    LA over Vegas in   Anaheim over San Jose in    East   Tampa Bay over New Jersey in   Boston over Toronto in   Washington over Columbus in   Philadelphia over Pittsburgh in   ,First Round Bracket,nhl

1,Let s say there s a trade like Phaneufs  How quickly do they get their jersey  Do they ever get held from a lineup if they don t get one in time for the next game ,How soon do NHL players get their new jerseys after a trade ,nhl
2,,What is a delayed penalty in English and not in NHL language  Why does the goalie leave if it s delayed  Am so confused  Thanks ,nhl
4,Hear me out  Taylor Hall should at least be in the talks for it and I barely hear anything about him   Is it because he s on the Devils   Hall is having a tremendous season and the Devils would not be anywhere near where they are now without him     He drives the Devils offense pretty well by himself  much like MacKinnon on the Avs   He is also on something crazy like a    game point streak with like    points   I personally don t think it s that crazy for him to be a runner up or even a winner if he can keep up this point streak for a little longer and maybe even have the devils make the playoffs   Open to people s thoughts on this opinion of mine  LMK,Am I crazy to think Hall should be in the running for the MVP ,nhl
7,How can they get on the right track again and get to the playoff  Their roster seems to be strong so whats holding them back ,Whats wrong with Chicago Blackcocks ,nhl
9,,Congrats Ovi on getting to       points ,nhl

140,As of right now the matchups in the East would be  TBL vs  CBJ  WSH vs  NJD  BOS vs  TOR  and PIT vs  PHI The West would be  VGK vs  MIN  NSH vs  STL  SJS vs  LAK  and WPG vs  DAL  Obviously there s still a lot of hockey to be played  but I like these matchups a lot  especially in the East   Boston vs  Toronto and Pittsburgh vs  Philadelphia are great rivalries   Tampa vs  Columbus would probably be the least entertaining but not terrible   Washington vs  New Jersey would be really interesting and could be surprisingly good   The matchups out west don t excite me as much  but Nashville vs  St  Louis would probably be really good  as would Winnipeg vs  Dallas   San Jose vs  Los Angeles is a good rivalry matchup even though San Jose is one of the least physical teams this year   Vegas vs  Minnesota could be really interesting  especially seeing what Vegas can do come playoff time   It s still early  but I would not complain if these were the first round matchups   Playoff hockey is always good  but the more rivalry matchups the better   I like the way the league sits right now  even though some teams will probably change come April   What do you guys think   Who do you want to see play in the first round  ,What does everyone want to see for first round playoff matchups ,nhl

124,Looking to do a little digging into goalie interference rulings  and I ve figured out how to tell if a goalie interference coaches challenge has occurred  but I can t figure out how to tell which way the challenge went other than looking at the following event to see if a timeout was used or not and or if the proceeding event was a goal  if it s considered goalie interference  there s no goal event logged   but that s not really ideal   Examples  COL TOR   Events     and     are related to the challenge  There s no goal event prior  and no timeout used  from which I can infer that the challenge was successful    CBJ VGK   Events    and    are related to the challenge  Event    is a goal event  and even    is a timeout  from which I can infer that the challenge was unsuccessful   So yeah  I can use the data to figure out if the challenge is successful or not  but it s kind of cumbersome and I m hoping I m missing something that shows the result of the challenge much more obviously   Also  if there s a better place to ask this  please tell me  First time digging into the NHL stats API  ,NHL API goalie interference results,nhl

191,So I just finished watching the All Star Skills Competition and saying the events were absolutely a bore would be an understatement  I don t know about everyone else  but what happened to all the fan engagement and the fun of the night  It used to be about having a fun time with the buds or the family and allowing casual or even non hockey fans to gain interest  The NHL has absolutely ruined what was a fantastic night  They took away the breakout challenge which brought us the hilarious sunglasses and fisherman hat ovi and the infamous Subban Jagr  They took out the draft for players which was hilarious  Just seeing Kessel get traded for being  un coachable  and ovi holding up a sign  pick me last so i can get the car   Even the goalie race where goalies would race in all their equipment to see the fastest skater  That s what the skills competition is supposed to be about  Having fun  having a laugh and gaining social media attention  not seeing who can grab a puck  put it on a sick  and toss it into a hoop    The league has to go back and look at       That was probably the most fun competition of all time and it gained the most viewers as well    Back in      I would ve said the NHL All Star Skills competition was by far the best of all leagues  but the NHL has taken such a step backwards  the NBA All Stars is easily better in all ways    Just my two cents tho  Love to hear what everyone else has to say ,NHL All Star    Disappointing ,nhl

211,The Canadiens captain s bad sequence    goal in    games  has led to ongoing trade rumours  Will the Habs trade their captain   Max Pacioretty has become  over the years  one of the NHL s most prolific snipers as he s had   straight    goal seasons  excluding the lockout shortened season back in          and he s done it without an elite    center  David Desharnais  Tomas Plekanec and Phillip Danault have been his more frequent centres over the past years  yet all of them are unquestionably    centres  So when the Habs acquired Jonathan Drouin from the Tampa Bay Lightning and transformed him into a center  some would ve expected Pacioretty to have his first career    goal season  Well  he s not even on pace for half of that total  scoring   goals in    games for Montreal  putting him at a abysmal    goal pace   So what s wrong with the guy  For starters  one thing that can explain his scoring difficulties is the team he plays for  the Montreal Canadiens  They re the third lowest scoring team in front of only Buffalo and Arizona  two teams that finish in the bottom tier year after year  To give you an idea of how much trouble they have putting the puck in the net  here s an example  The Vegas Golden Knights  the very surprising expansion team  have   players with more points than Montreal s leading scorer  Alex Galchenyuk who has    points in    games putting him on a pace for a    point year  That s just plain embarrassing and therefore shows that the lack of offensive punch in Montreal is contributing to Pacioretty s slump  The second reason is obvious  the loss of Alexander Radulov  To start the         season  Pacioretty had only   goals in    games  Then during a game against the LA Kings on December  th of       he was placed on a line with Radulov  The rest is just history   From that game on to the end of the regular season  Pacioretty lit the lamp    times in    games playing with the Russian for the rest of the season  If he kept that pace for one full season  it s a    goal year  Since Radulov left for Dallas  the captain just isn t his usual self  Another big reason Pacioretty is struggling is the hiring of Claude Julien and the firing of Michel Therrien  Julien s teams have always played a very defensive style while Therrien s teams have always played a fast style that would help create turnovers  Since Julien was hired  Pacioretty has    goals in    games which is     goals per game compared to the time with Therrien where he had     goals in     games which is about      goals per game  includes playoffs   He basically scores twice more when under Therrien than under Julien  Let s also not forget that Pacioretty had a stunning   goals in   games in the playoffs last year  also under Julien  It s clear to everyone that Pacioretty plays way better under Therrien than under Julien   The final reason explaining Pacioretty s failures makes a lot of sense  Maybe he just dislikes playing in Montreal  Just being a player for a team like that means you ll be obliged to handle criticism and scrutiny from the media and all the fans  But being the captain of the hockey Mecca that the Montreal market is puts an extreme amount of pressure on the player and that leads to a bunch of distractions on and off the ice  especially when the team is losing  because when you think of what a true captain is like  he s supposed to lead the team out of the slump  Well that s just the opposite of what Pacioretty is doing  So with all this said  does it make sense for the Canadiens organization to part ways with their leader  Yes  it really does  Pacioretty just needs a fresh start with a team where there won t be many distractions and where he ll be able to focus on hockey  For the Canadiens  it makes perfect sense  especially with the situation they re in  Geoff Molson doesn t want to admit it  Marc Bergevin doesn t want to admit it  Claude Julien doesn t want to admit it  However  what s clear is clear  The Montreal Canadiens  with their actual roster and situation won t compete for even the playoffs anytime soon  The best path for them is to rebuild  and trading Pacioretty is the best start because if Marc Bergevin pulls the trigger on a deal like that  he s sending that exact message  So Marc  if you re looking at this article  strongly consider a rebuild and get rid of hefty contracts like Weber s and Shaw s and get rid of your veterans  Start building the Montreal Canadiens future foundation because you and your team won t get anywhere if you re still competing for a playoff spot   Now that you think about it  what s the point of making the playoffs when you know your roster isn t built enough for a run at the Stanley Cup  It s why the players play and it s why you make trades  to win the most prestigious award in possibly all of sports  So the only trades you can make now to get that team somewhere are the ones where you receive good draft picks and solid prospects  And that all starts with Max Pacioretty   Tags  feature  Montreal Canadiens  NHL,Addressing the Pacioretty trade rumours,nhl

446,I found this Vlasic interview very intriguing because there is a couple of things that can be drawn out from it    Interview in question     The first question of the interview asks Vlasic  what does their five goal output from tonight due to the conception of the sharks that they have lost offence with the departure of Patrick Marceau  Vlasic responds jokingly with  the sharks can score goals  huh  we can play exciting hockey   From here we can deduct a couple of things  One  Vlasic was aware of this depiction of the Sharks  Now the more important question is whether or not he agrees with that statement  One could argue that he does  that Vlasic is recalling the days when the Sharks could score five goals with relative ease  Now one could argue in response he s making the joke because he knew eventually the goal draught would end based on their play because as he says  the sharks have had the chances in the past but just weren t able to hit the back of the net   I think judging on the next two questions and answers that the former will be revealed to be more likely    In the second question  the interviewer asks about is Logan Couture reaching the halfway point of his goal for a thirty goal season  tried to phrase that as well as I could    sorry   and how getting Corture going plays into the Shark s strategy for success  Vlasic s response is interesting  Vlasic states that it s not Couture who needs to get going to replace some of the offence that the Sharks lost during the off season  He says that Couture is a     goal scorer playing against the top d lines in the league  If we look at last season  thirty goals puts Couture around the top   th   th mark for goal scorer s in the league  His actual number for last year      puts him at   th  Regardless  Vlasic has just described Couture as one of the lower mid elite tier players in the league  Vlasic goes on to say the rest of the Sharks need to get up to that level of their play  therefore labelling Couture as the Shark s best player  That s not a pretty picture that he describes for his team if Couture is there top player    Now the third question  when asked about what direction he feels the team is headed  Vlasic replies with the PR answer   I think we re playing well  couple points out of first place in the division  every nights a battle  and that not every night is a guaranteed win  In doing so he clearly creates a divide between where the Sharks were two years ago and where they are now    Now let s revisit our first question with the analysis above in mind  Vlasic thinks that the Sharks aren t as good as they were and he s not fully confident about where the team is headed  That being said  they are winning right now  so we will see where the Sharks go from here  ,More than meets the eye in this Vlasic interview   ,nhl

335,The only next logical steps for the asshats trying their best to call fouls like the NBA instead of penalties  is foul shots from the slot for slashing calls   No wonder they have been sliding in popularity  NHL players were once viewed on a different level of toughness as athletes    The rules are now crafted to take any credibility to that notion away   It was awful to watch the Bruins home opener and feel like they won a respectable game   This is because those coward referees did what they were told despite the fact they should have known better and refused for the sake of the game   If this keeps up I will be boycotting again as I did the season following the Bruins      playoff failure against Montreal as the number one seed   That was pathetic hockey to watch as has been the opening games this year thanks to the refs   ,Congratulation to the NHL rule makers and the pathetic refs who are willing to destroy the game   ,nhl

99,One of the best  Sure  We can probably solidify that   I ll begin at a crucial point  Lemieux had an almost identical Points Per Game rate as Gretzky       to       and played in lower scoring seasons  Who was the better forward between them  Hard to say  Equally Mario never got to reach those milestone heights due to intense diseases outside his control   Not to mention things like secondary assists  I m not certain but Mike Bossy  could  have had a fairly similar or maaaybe higher Primary Point Rate to Gretzky  He scored goals at a much higher rate  I mean there s so much we need to fully assess  Ice Time is naturally crucial  linemate quality also etc   Hasek had the best goaltending impact by an extremely wide margin  his GSAA numbers and ability make you question if he s mortal or not  Orr similarly for D in terms of scoring and his talent was preposterous  They re both head and shoulders above their peers and D   G are either about as valuable as F or more   Gretzky was amazingly fortunate  He came into the league at exactly the perfect time  He benefitted immensely from the era of kick save goaltending and haphazard D strategy  among other nuances  Sid is easily one of the best ever as well and could very well have a greater impact than Gretzky all told   Not to mention that GF  ultimately is the ideal measurement of skater impact    but that s a whole other kettle of beans and gets us into really tricky territory like trying to unravel     numbers from the   s   At the end of the day the GOAT discussion is a sketchy one  It s very difficult given the   main candidates play   different positions and only two played in the same era  Which is fine  it makes for interesting discussion  it s fun to investigate  I hope this can help constructively get the ball rolling at very least ,There s no evidence to support the claim that Gretzky is definitively the GOAT,nhl

153,Why do we do this  anyways  Is it because everyone likes to play  backseat GM  and claim that we wouldn t make these poor executive decisions  Is it because we are gluttons for punishment and like to torture ourselves by remembering the dark times  Regardless  it doesn t matter how many trade deadlines the league goes through  there always comes that time when the hockey viewing populous reminisces over the worst transactions made   The NHL is about turn     years old  which means there is plenty of time for front offices to fudge a trade decision at least once  But no matter how many transactions occur  everyone still looks back on Adam Oates making Red Wings history  Or Eric Lindros being swapped for half a roster  Or  everyone s favorite  The Great One jetting off to California   What makes these trades so bad isn t necessarily the trades themselves  but the aftermath of them  Here are the NHL s top    all time worst trades in no particular order The trade  The Atlanta Thrashers traded Marian Hossa  along with winger Pascal Dupuis  to the Pittsburgh Penguins for Colby Armstrong  Angelo Esposito  Eric Christensen  and a first round draft pick   The aftermath  Here is a textbook  bad trade   Before they moved up to Manitoba to be the Winnipeg Jets  the now debunked Thrashers lost a lot  but had a chance to give itself a makeover  So they shipped star player Hossa to Pittsburgh  That plan didn t work in their favor however  as Atlanta s takeaway from the trade didn t evolve into anything substantial   Hossa s future was significantly brighter  He was part of the Stanley Cup contending Pens and Detroit Red Wings before winning two championships during his current lengthy tenure with the Chicago Blackhawks  Even though the scoring Slovak is pushing     he continues to churn out points      career goals      career assists  and climb the NHL all time goals list      Roberto LuongoThe trade  The Florida Panthers traded Roberto Luongo  Lukas Krajicek  and a sixth round pick to the Vancouver Canucks in exchange for Todd Bertuzzi  Alex Auld  and Bryan Allen          The aftermath  Oh yes  Luongo s first stint in net for Florida  That stretched ended with quite well for the netminder  who headed to Vancouver to become a pillar for the competitive Canucks team we know so well from the early     s   In return for the goalie and company  the Panthers got a troubled Bertuzzi  who only lasted a handful of games before being shipped off to Detroit   and then Anaheim  and then Calgary  and then back to Detroit   Luongo has since returned to Florida and has been bit by the injury bug on a couple occasions  But back in       he came out on the good end of a bad trade for the Panthers      Jaromir JagrThe trade  The Pittsburgh Penguins traded Jaromir Jagr  along with defenseman Frantisek Kucera  to the Washington Capitals for Kris Beech  Michal Sivek  Ross Lupaschuk  future considerations  and cash          The aftermath  Once upon a hockey  a    year old Czech superstar named Jagr decided that he wanted a trade from the Penguins  team that he had won a couple Stanley Cups with  While both parties are doing just fine now  there was no happy ending immediately after the trade  Pittsburgh s return for the league s leading goal scorer produced    goals     of which came from Beech   Jagr on the other hand  was signed to a huge seven year contract for the Capitals and continued registering points at an alarming rate   although it was pretty well known how unhappy he was in Washington  They traded him to the New York Rangers in           Adam OatesThe trade  The Detroit Red Wings moved Adam Oates  along with Paul MacLean  to the St  Louis Blues for Bernie Federko and Tony McKegney          The aftermath  This was called  by many outlets  the worst trade in Red Wings history  Federko retired after a year  and McKegney only lasted    games amid some serious character issues in Detroit s dressing room   Oates was reportedly devastated by his trade  While his departure from St  Louis a couple years later was incredibly messy  his time with the Blues will forever be a highlight of his Hall of Fame career  He notched    assists in the         campaign  most of those registered as the step up for Oates  hockey partner in crime  Brett Hull  The success of the dynamic duo left plenty to wonder whether or not Oates could have reached those numbers in a Red Wings sweater  instead of in St  Louis with the Golden Brett      Brett HullThe trade  The Calgary Flames trade young stud Hull  along with Steve Bozek  to the St  Louis Blues for veterans Rob Ramage and Rick Wamsley          The aftermath  The trade for the other half of the  Hull and Oates  duo is quite interesting  On one hand  the Flames hoisted Lord Stanley s Mug in       On the other hand  that followed a downward trend while Hull scored    goals in    games in during the         season  and    goals in    games the following season  Of course  that         season marks the debut of Hull teaming up with Adam Oates to become one of the best duos that the game has ever seen   How many of those many goals for the Blues would Hull have scored for Calgary  How many records would he have set for the Flames  Like the number of licks it takes to get to the center of the Tootsie pop  the world may never know   Forget about bad weather  Here are the real reasons why the New York Yankees ticket sales keep dropping      Marcel DionneThe trade  The Detroit Red Wings traded Dionne and Bart Crashley to the LA Kings for Terry Harper  Dan Maloney  and a second round draft pick in               The aftermath  How does a player get traded after a     point season  The team they play for doesn t like said player s contract demands and ships them off  Such was the case for Dionne  as a contract dispute punched his ticket out of Detroit   Harper and Maloney faired okay over the course of the next few season  But they didn t make the mark that Dionne made  with five consecutive     point seasons over a decade of service in a Kings  sweater      Cam NeelyThe trade  The Vancouver Canucks shipped Neely and their first round pick to the Boston Bruins for Barry Pederson          The aftermath  In the wide world of lopsided trades  the Cam Neely trade is one of the best recognized   Although it isn t as uneven as the Eric Lindros acquisition  but more on that later    It s a simple tale  Before the trade  Pederson s numbers were superior to those of young British Columbia product Neely  After the trade  all of that changed  Pederson s number dropped during his tenure in Vancouver  Neely s career flourished   tallying both goals and penalty minutes   and he went on to have a Hall of Fame career  star in a couple movies  and eventually be president of the Bruins      Phil EspositoThe trade  The Chicago Blackhawks traded Phil Esposito  along with Ken Hodge and Fred Stanfield  to the Boston Bruins in exchange for Gilles Marotte  Pit Martin  and Jack Norris   The aftermath  For as much as Esposito didn t fit the program in Chicago  this ended up being one heck of a steal for Boston  He led the NHL in scoring five times during his tenure with the Bruins and established himself as a key cog in the B s roster   In fact the whole trade was profitable for Boston  with Stanfield putting up regular points and Hodge registering a couple     plus point seasons      Wayne GretzkyThe trade  The Edmonton Oilers traded Wayne Gretzky  along with Marty McSorely and Mike Krushelnyski  to the Kings in exchange for Jimmy Carson  Martin Gelinas  three first round picks  and     million          The aftermath  Depending on what listicle you look at  this is rated as the worst trade ever to occur in the kingdom of hockey  No doubt because it is one of  if not the  most emotional trade to date  The fact that the Oilers won a Cup after the trade doesn t even make a difference   Canada s greatest athlete and celebrity was shipped off to Hollywood  and Edmonton did not take it well  Like  Oilers  GM Peter Pocklington received death threats because Oilers fans could not except it  It s still a hot discussion topic whether or not the Gretzky trade was the first move in disassembling the unstoppable Oilers dynasty  Jari Kurri and Mark Messier departed just a couple seasons later  and others followed through the early    s  While The Great One returned up north and his No     was retired and raised in Edmonton  there is no doubt that the trade of     still stings       Eric LindrosThe trade  The Quebec Nordiques traded Eric Lindros to the Philadelphia Flyers for Steve Duchesne  Peter Forsberg  Ron Hextall  Kerry Huffman  Mike Ricci  and Chris Simon  as well as two draft picks and     million          The aftermath  Eric Lindros was supposed to be the next big thing  a winning combination of every great player to ever inhabit the NHL  He didn t want to play for the Nordiques  who drafted him first overall in       and Philadelphia saw an opportunity  Lindros was a spectacle for a hot minute for the Flyers  Then injuries bogged him down and hampered his career  He never brought the Cup to Philly    The pack of juggernauts that the Flyers sent to the Nordiques  on the other hand  was the roster makeover that Quebec needed  The new fangled squad moved from Quebec to Colorado  and became the Stanley Cup

169,In       in a Game between the Dallas Stars and the Edmonton Oilers the stars was winning      oilers pulled their goalie and Stefan got a breakway into a Empty Net but misses created a turnover and the Oilers ties the Game and get   points   With that point they passed the Hawks and the Hawks won the lottery of Patrick Kane    But what if Stefan scores in the Empty Net and Dallas would have won the game   First Kane would be a Edmonton Oilers and Sam Gagner and BlackHawks  So my guess is Hawks would be bad with Sam Gagner and they will miss the playoffs and finish second last  and get the second overall pick in      Drew Doughty  And the oilers will most likely by better than the Hawks but worst than the real Hawks in       so My guess is the   th overall pick  Cody Hodgson  Let s fast foward   years in       So in      the Hawks Have Sam Gagner Toews Doughty Keith Seabrook Saad Hossa Sharp Shaw and since Doughty wont make     M like Kane there is space for Leddy and Oduya  They won a Stanley Cup in       Like in real life  but not in      In the Summer they trade Sam Gagner for some Depth  And for the Oilers  they didnt draft Hall Nudge and Yakupov  but draft Seguin instead of Hall and they draft Oleksiak instead of Nudge and in      they make the playoffs as the  th seed and get rekt in the first round and draft Olli Maata then trade Hemsky for a decent defensman  A young Shattenkirk  Steal of the year    In       they got elimated in the second round and draft Theodore   And now in       In       the Oilers won the cup because of Kane and Seguin In       they got eliminated by the Hawks in    In      they won another Stanley Cup and      Kane and Seguin are injured and they finished  th last and got Nico Hischier   In       the Hawks got eliminated by the Oilers but they won agains the Oilers in      to make the Stanley Cup Final but loose to Tampa Bay  in      they lost in the second round and in      they got eliminated in the western conference finals by the NashVille Predators   So thats it if Stefan scores in the Empty Net   Oilers win   cups Hawks win   cups Hawks first Line  Saad Toews Sharp Doughty Keith Oilers first line  Maroon Seguin Kane  Shattenkirk Maata  And Connor Mcdavid goes to Arizona  Panarin will most likely not signed with the Hawks but with the Habs  ,What if Patrik Stefan dont miss the Empty Net  ,nhl

21,Alright  so Adidas is taking over for Reebok and some jerseys got a lot better while some either stayed the same or missed an opportunity to get better  Let s start   All pics from  Icethetics     Bardown    and  The  Unofficial  NHL Uniform Database        Anahiem      I would be a big fan of the Ducks using the current colour scheme on the   s jerseys   Or just going back to them completely    but that is never going to happen  The whole side stripe design is bollocks  Always have dug the orange shoulder piping against the black jersey  Missed opportunity to get better  though      Arizona      One day they will come to their senses and slap some green in there and the world will be a better place  Look at the inside of the neck   they want to go old school so bad  When they brought the    s jerseys out    for those throwback nights  you can t tell me time hasn t been nice to those  Probably best jersey they ve had with this logo  but still  missed opportunity       Boston      Same old classic       Buffalo      Praise baby Jesus  they got rid of that fucking piping on the chest  Looks like the armpit nonsense is gone  too  Good job  Those numbers are still on the chest  though  first team to start it  and now last team to have them   C mon  man       Calgary      Gone are the dumb chest  and arm  piping  I wish for a return of  the   s look    but this is better than the last years      Carolina      Probably Top   for coming out of this better  Welcome back checkered stripes on the bottom  albeit  a little fainter than before  and in the neck  Nice touch  All that is missing is  the white shoulder piping    and these would be as perfect as you could ask for       Chicago      Same old classic      Colorado      If you re an Avs fan  you re probably really happy  I personally love the newer logo jerseys better  but gone are the body piping and the old style is back in business  In case you haven t noticed  if a jersey had body piping  I hated it       Columbus      Same old  I ve seen some fan concepts that totally kill their jerseys  but that is a dream  Could be worse    By the way  I love what Columbus has done to their arena and the core of buildings and bars restaurants around it  Great experience going to a CBJs game  would go again       Can t hate the cannon  either  even if it does catch you off guard the first time  p     Dallas      Was never a fan of the new logo or jersey  Still not   Victory Green  on the inside of the neck      Detroit      Same old classic      Edmonton      Orange takes over blue for the home sweater  Arm numbers return to the sides  mercifully      Florida      Was never a fan of the stripe not going the whole way around the jersey  Doubt that has changed  Numbers on the shoulders   nope       Los Angeles      Easily their best sets of jerseys since  the Gretzky era    Thankfully  nothing has changed      Minnesota      Interesting  The red stripe on the arms really adds a nice little touch  Up there with Carolina for one of the better improvements       Montreal      Same old classic   Nos Bras Meurtris Vous Tendent Le Flambeau    To you from failing hands we throw the torch   on the inside of the neck       Nashville      Can t fuck with those keys on the inside collar they ve had since      Again  happy they got rid of the body piping       New Jersey      White stripes on the arms got bigger  First time I saw it I had to take a second look  Inside of the collar  in green  niccee   the three Cup years       New York Islanders      Same old classic  I FUCKING BEG YOU TO NEVER CHANGE  NEVER  EVER   please     New York Rangers      Same old classic   Est        with the Rangers shield on the inside collar       Ottawa       Will you go back to the   s already  or at least go back to that logo      I don t know anyone that wouldn t want that look back  I actually dig the square arm design better now than the round design Reebok had       Philadelphia      Same old classic      Pittsburgh      Same old classic      San Jose      Try as these guys might  they can t seem to get their jerseys  or logo  for that matter  right since the  Owen Nolan days    Nothing on the bottom of the jerseys still make these look empty  like those first Reebok Leafs ones   yikes   Nothing about SJ s sweaters look good  Missed opportunity       St  Louis      Keeping with what Reebok fixed from their first go  that fucking BODY PIPING   they add a beautiful design  city flag  anyone wanna confirm   to the inside of their collars  Classic       Tampa Bay      I  for one  think that this incarnation of their jerseys is the best in every way  So good on them for not messing with it  If it s not broken  don t fix it      Toronto      Same old classic  THAT BEING SAID  there will come the day they get rid of that one stripe shit at the bottom of the jersey and put in the normal two  and bring back the nine stripe socks  Never understood why they got rid of that   would have made for the best Leafs jersey ever  Ever   Honour  Courage  Pride   remains on the inner collar      Vancouver      WE KNOW WHAT CITY YOU RE FROM  FOR FUCKS SAKE  GET RID OF THE CITY NAME  WE GET IT       Vegas Golden Knights      A mess  Like Winnipeg  probably not the best look to start the franchise off  but what can you do  Not a fan of anything really  except for all the details in the logo and sleeves  Reminds me of the jerseys from the last Winter Olympics  Maybe they will look better in person  Even though these  Canucks jerseys    had the opposite effect on me and I couldn t  wait  to see them  I must say  though  there is this pic taken in their team shop  or in front of it    of a  mannequin dressed as a knight    Golden helmet with pitch black armour  Looked fucking sweet  Good third jersey look   Vegas  on the inside collar      Washington      Stayed the course  Arm piping has straightened  Just go back to the   s look already       Winnipeg      Shit jerseys with a secondary looking logo as their main   See your Heritage jersey     Yeah  get on that  New and or old  no one ever asked for a rebranding  ,My Unasked for Adidas Jersey Review Opinion Nagging,nhl

24,This seems rather questionable  Now that he is no longer making     mil or   mil  but rather   mil for the next four seasons  NOW he has an equipment allergy      Me thinks this might be a ploy that benefits both the Hawks and Hossa       Obviously  this would allow Hawks to put Hossa on LTIR and would be relieved of his      mil cap hit CONVENIENTLY when they are in cap trouble      Hossa was probably considering retirement  contrary to his exit interview  but didn t want to screw the Hawks over  Why would he wake up every day to go to practice and play hockey for   mil for the next four years    Something about this just isn t  right  and this is one of the most Blackhawks things ever  Sign a guy to a then monster contract only to later alleviate any repercussions from that monster contract    Thoughts ,Hossa Allergies ,nhl

67,What could the Vegas Golden Knight s opening night lineup  should they keep all the players they drafted  It s not likely but it gives a good idea of the level of competition they d bring to the table this upcoming season  Just a rough estimate  and of course it all comes down to how they play when the team comes together to practice before the start of the regular season  but the team could look somewhat like     James Neal Cody Eakin Jon Marchessault  David Perron Mikhail Grabovski Reilly Smith  Erik Haula Oscar Lindberg David Clarkson  Pierre Edouard Bellemare William Karlsson Chris Thorburn  William Carrier Thomas Nosek Teemu Pulkkinen   Marc Methot Trevor Van Reimsdyk  Luca Sbisa    Alexei Emelin  David Schlemko    Deryk Engelland  Jason Garrison Clayton Stoner   Marc Andre Fleury  Calvin PIckard  J F Berube   Formatting is weird on reddit  I m not used to this here ,Vegas Golden Knights potential lines,nhl

207,Ilya Kovalchuk is    years old  and the New Jersey Devils have the rights to him for   more year    The rumors of him playing for either the New York Rangers or Columbus Blue Jackets are absurd   The Devils would never trade him to a division rival unless they were insanely over paid for him   And why would Torterella want someone like Kovalchuk when CBJ didn t even bother calling up an offensive minded  scorer like Sonny Milano  Because Milano most likely wouldn t play well under Tort  THE ONLY option for him returning would be at    years old  when the Devils no longer have the rights to him    And at that point  it d be no surprise to anyone for the Rangers to overpay for a washed up star  I can see teams making him offers  but I would never see his offers being worth more than CKA   If anything maybe a cup contender team may pick him up for depth for   year   It s just not likely for him to return ,As a Devils fan  I hate hearing all of the talk about Kovalchuk possibly returning  So I am going to debunk the rumor now,nhl

187,For the Stanley Cup final it s hard to watch a player go down on a routine cross check   Easy diving call  Make it a   on   when a Pens player trips on his own skates    so frustrating to watch ,  soft penalties    ,nhl

191,You are all some salty ass motherfuckers  I can t wait to see how far this gets downvoted  ,Hahahahahahahahhahah,nhl
194,A terrible call on the disallowed goal  the Neal call was good but the other call was not   This completely ruined the momentum of the game  This is a disaster to watch and I m not even a Preds fan  I can only imagine what it s like for them   This is terrible to watch   It s one thing to play bad  it s another thing to have your momentum unjustifiably ripped from you  Which will ultimately effect the rest of the game play   If you believe that offsides call was justified  I believe there needs to be a discussion of where do you draw the line  How far back can you go to review a play  That was a long possession    These bad calls made the rest of that period almost unbearable to watch ,Bad calls serve as catalyst for disaster game   Not Preds fan ,nhl

204,     I know I made a bit of a troll esque post just a few minutes ago but this time I m looking for some serious discussion        What s irked me most about every series of this playoffs not just the pens series    and every playoffs for the past couple of seasons  is the idea of  playoff hockey   meaning that certain calls that would be made in the regular season aren t because it s the playoffs  I get the general idea of it   you don t want games of this importance decided by a bunch of penalties  but I also think that this is the cause of a lot of the generally shit refereeing throughout the playoffs        When the rules aren t strictly enforced and there s leeway with what s acceptable it means that the refs have far too much of an effect on the outcomes of games   If the rules aren t concrete then what s the point of even having them  and I m certainly not suggesting that would be a good idea   There must be consistency with the calls on both sides  Thats the only way that there is legitimacy in the game        I think it starts with the announcers and commentators who seemingly defend this loose style  I think that this is by far the biggest issue  mentality change that needs to take place in order to have a fun  exciting  and ultimately enjoyable playoffs  Just my two cents I d be interested in hearing what others think          Also obligatory apology for my earlier antics it was a heat of the moment post   ,About the idea of  Playoff Hockey ,nhl
206,The refs missed the Crosby interference in the first but also missed the hook on Crosby at the end of the second  The first penalty call on that     was awful but what was that call on Ian Cole   I have watched atrocious calls for both sides game after game  The offsides rule sucks but that is because the NHL sucks  That s it   So are we watching the same game or     ,The refs suck but you re high as a kite if you think they are favoring any one team ,nhl

214,I ve very very casually watched hockey in the past but I wanted to start getting more into it  I usually follow teams that have maybe one great player star and then a coach who really knows how to make the best out of everyone  Like the Pats in football  and I follow the thunder in basketball because Russ is so fucking fun to watch  Are there any similar teams that would be a good place for me to start ,Help me pick a team ,nhl

216,  shots in    minutes  From the almighty PENGUINS        yeah  the refs handed the Penguins the first period  but Nashville was so clearly the better team the entire game      could be a very interesting series      let s see what happens ,What a dominating performance from Nashville ,nhl
217,If he makes a few saves the preds win  Guentzel and Malkin goals were bad bad bad bad bad,The NHL can t control Rinne s glove,nhl
218,After watching game one of the Stanley Cup playoffs  I have to say that I m pretty disappointed with the NHL  First of all the questionable goal overturn call on an already outdated rule was a disheartening way to start the game  As the game continued there were questionable penalties being called on both sides    Another disappointment I have is with the majority of the coverage talking about how Nashville is the clear underdog  I feel like at this point in the playoffs the teams are evenly matched  Nashville had only lost   playoff games coming into the series and they had a sweep of the number one seed in the western conference    The one positive outcome I saw from tonight s game were from the players and coaches  Nashville didn t get sloppy or dirty when all the calls were going against them and they were down      Same goes to Pittsburgh when they didn t have a shot on goal for     minutes   Right now the players and the actual game of hockey are persuading me to continue watching this series because I m very disappointed in the NHL  ,Disappointed with the NHL,nhl
219,Based on the current ruling that was a       call that personally I think should have been ruled inconclusive and counted as a goal   I haven t seen a blue  edit  line camera angle yet only the crap they showed on TV    With that said    Was it really the entry into the zone that caused the goal  I understand if the preds walked in off the line and went bar down but they spent    seconds in the zone and retrieved the puck off a Pitt turnover  At what point do we consider the entry to be irrelevant   Look at it this way  What if that    seconds was actually     minutes of sustained zone time  Does the fractional   oh he lifted his toe slightly   offside REALLY have as big an impact as the defending team not being able to clear the zone     Unfortunate momentum swing early in the game but I think we re in for a good series   ,Offside Review,nhl

224,Bad calls aside  we just witnessed the defending champions held to   shots for    minutes by the   th seed team   an own goal  an unsuccessful   goal comeback  and a      save percentage in a SCF game  ,Historic Game,nhl
225,Who do the Devils grab at     Hischier seems to have the higher ceiling and be flashier  but Patrick seems to have the higher floor and has the better pedigree   Who would you select if you were Ray Shero ,Nolan Patrick or Nico Hischier ,nhl
226,Were some of the calls questionable  Definitely  Is every sport reffed by a species that has flaws and people make mistakes  Believe it or not  yes  In game   for the pens against ottowa  Sidney Crosby got held and beaten the entire game while not near the puck and replay showed it very clearly  Next to that  a weak call led to a goal and the senators winning that game eventually  Refs can obviously be a big factor but that s the nature of any sport  Just get over it and continue on with your lives ,I know it s not a popular opinion being a penguins fan here  but I gotta say bad calls are the nature of the game and people should stop complaining and just deal ,nhl
228,inb downvotes but let me say this  the refs have sucked ass all playoffs on all sides  The refs were extremely biased against the Pens in the Ottawa series  Saying it s  rigged  for Pittsburgh is wrong  The NHL fucking hates the Pens  why would they want them to win ,I honestly don t know why people say it s rigged for the pens ,nhl
229,Because they seemed awfully concerned with saving the Penguins  ,The refs must have been Antarctic scientists  ,nhl
231, removed ,I don t understand some of you   ,nhl
232,Sure  the refs deflated Nashville s momentum by taking back PK s goal  but they didn t make Rinne miss easy saves and post a      save percentage  I understand its gotta be tough to stay focused when you don t see a shot in    min  but he had clear lines of sight on both the Malkin goal and the Guentzel goal  These are saves that he has to make if Nashville wants to win a cup ,The refs didn t lose the game for Nashville  Rinne did,nhl
233,Are you guys serious         Goal     It s a goddamn   on    Evgeni Malkin gets a wide open clapper from the high slot and fires it   hole at     mph  If Rinne saves that  he s god          Goal     Beautiful play by the Penguins  Beautiful pass by Crosby to Kunitz in the high slot  Kunitz with the no look feed to Sheary  No chance for Rinne  If he saves that  he s god        Goal     Complete ass        Goal     This is the one that could be up for debate  I personally think it was a beautiful shot from Guentzel  top corner  with a quick release around Ryan Ellis  But he could have had this one for sure  Keep in mind it was the first shot he saw in    minutes        At the end of the day  I understand you win and lose as a team  Rinne is part of the team  and obviously he could have played better  But that being said  the Predators still deserved  as a team  to win last night s game  But the refs fucked them way too hard in the  st  If you disagree with me  I would love to hear your reasoning   ,You can t blame Rinne for that loss ,nhl

236,I will be posting my opinion  however I feel it is important to state that I am a New Jersey Devils fan  and I cry in to my Kovalchuk jersey every night  and that I am not necessarily  rooting  for any particular team   I am curious about your input on each individual topic below   The offsides  disallowed goal   The rules are the rules   And the call was made accordingly  nothing you can really justifiably argue against   I personally hate the replay challenge  and how close of a call it was in this instance  I also feel that the rule is not concrete   In the sense that  how far back of a play without stoppage should you be able to challenge  The Predators were in the zone for a long time   THIS call completely sweeped the momentum of the game clean  which was  in my opinion  favoring Nashville at the time   The two penalties resulting in a   on    The cross check from behind is an obvious call  The one in front of the net seemed to be the Penguin player slipping on his own  does anyone have any video showing otherwise  This call shortly after the disallowed goal  completely threw the game off   When they scored on the power play there was an evident momentum swing  And then shortly after I believe Sheary scored on a defensive breakdown   Pekka Rinnes GAA Save   The announcers were saying since he was able to see Malkins point shot  he should of had that one  That s a joke  It s Malkin  taking a wide open slap shot at the top of the slot         stfu   Sheary was a defensive breakdown  the own goal was unfortunate  and Guentzel absolutely sniped   I don t believe his GAA Save   from game   is relevant to how great of a goalie he is     The refs siding with the Penguins  It s just not true   There were a series of unfortunate events for the Preds  and it s a shame to happen in the cup finals  but it is what it is   It s a best of    so there is no reason to panic over   bad game   For me personally  it was becoming unbearable to watch after the own goal  It felt like I was watching a disaster unravel  I am hoping the refs will make better calls in the games to come   It will be an entertaining series though , Discussion  Game   in summary,nhl
239,I can t shake the feeling that the NHL is biased in favor of the Penguins  Calls always seem to go their way and announcers act like they should be everyone s favorite   However I admit I m biased against them  I really dislike them   So instead of asking about calls that go in their favor  I have a different question    can anyone think of times where bad calls have gone AGAINST them  Like we should expect to see if things really are fair   I can t think of any but again  I know I m biased  and I also don t watch them that much  I m willing to be shown I m wrong ,Times bad calls have gone AGAINST the Penguins ,nhl
240,Offside challenging is the worst thing to happen to hockey in awhile  It takes away from the excitement as a fan or player  Goals are getting taken back for millimeters  It doesn t fit the game of hockey  ,Offside Challening ,nhl
242,Pittsburgh was absolutely humiliated but still won   Bettman has turned this league into a laughing stock  No shots for    minutes and they still win the game  This Stanley Cup means nothing and   respect will be gained if Pittsburgh wins again  The way they played last night makes you wonder how they even made it in the finals  If Preds lose the series I m done with hockey ,Was game   the most one sided rigged hockey game win that we ve ever seen ,nhl
244,Obviously  it s much easier and makes way more sense for the league to rig not one  but two seasons in order to get the Penguins to win two back to back cups   But in order to make it looked not rigged they re going to get all the owners on board and other top players to stop wanting to win and just let it happen   They need the Caps to win the presidents trophy and then gracefully bow it for the   nd straight year which I m sure they ll be perfectly fine doing  no one wants to win a cup after trying their entire adult lives anyway  right   This is much more likely than Rinne having a bad night against a team he has never beaten before     Seriously  what the fuck is wrong with your brain if you think the league is rigging the season to get the Pens the cup    again   If you think this is a legit inside job  than you are either blinded by your hate for a team that s better than yours  or you seriously have something wrong with your brain and should go get some help   ,Proof that the NHL has rigged the season for the Pens,nhl
257,I m watching the Pens vs Preds game  and I am surprised that fans were booing Kunitz at the pre game presentation  and also after he was awarded an assist for Bonino s goal     I don t understand  isn t he the man who got the Pens a ticket to the finals in double OT  Why hate him so ,Why are Pens fans booing Kunitz ,nhl
269,Just wondering what everyone is thinking will happen for the game tonight   I think that the preds will come out guns blazing and throw an onslaught of shots at Murray  Rinne needs to get his reflexes working a little faster but all in all I see Nashville bouncing back and taking game   in route to a lengthy   or   game series    Prediction  Nashville    Pittsburgh  ,Game   Predictions ,nhl

275,It seems as if all the momentum has shiffted and the pens are taking full advantage   I was thinking the pens would lose the way they have been playing but this cup is going to be a toss up  ,A completley different game ,nhl
276,So Malkin taps a guy with his stick and he losses balance and that s a penalty  Sorry no     Kunitz cross checking Subban s neck is blatantly a penalty though     I dont see how either of these are arguable   ,Malkin   not a penalty Kunitz  penalty,nhl
277,RIP Boninos ankle,Ouch,nhl
278,This game is definetly advantage preds as far as officiating goes  The non call on Cullen and a weak call against Malkin prove that   Officiating is bad and Pittsburgh is good ,For those last game complaining the refs are on the pens side,nhl

285,Right now  it seems like the Preds are playing distracted  It looks like they re angry about the officiating of game one  rather than focusing on how well they actually played  This series is getting nasty very fast  and while it makes for a very entertaining game  the Pens will take the series quickly if it continues this way  Predators need to get it together so we can see a GOOD series that could go either way ,My thoughts on game two  so far ,nhl

299,I thought they would win tonight and even the series up  As a sharks fan this is really reminiscent of last year and the run against the pens then   Coming back from a     series is really hard to do  They need to win both games in Nashville to make this stay competitive at all    Rinne wasn t really the problem IMO  the defense was  They looked great in the first  the goal was just bad luck  he was in good position and it just slipped by  and alright in the second but by the  rd the defense just seemed to give up   Nashville never really had any offense other than in the first and I m pretty sure they were outshot too   If I was a Nashville fan  and for the next few weeks I sure am  I would want to see the following in this order    More calm  They had   penalties this game and no powerplay goals  Taking a penalty just kills the time that you could have had to have some offense  Instead of crosschecking someone to the ground  how about taking a few more shots    More confidence  Open ice  clean  hits are great  You guys basically let the penguins go through the neutral zone untouched by the  rd  There were lots of   on   and breakaways  To be honest it s a miracle you guys didn t lose by more      No blaming  The penguins are savvy  This is not their first trip  For you guys it is  This is just a series like any other one  The penguins are completely gassed  most are very injured  If you just step back and play like you did against the blues or the ducks you can put up a good fight      Watch for speed  To counter the last point  you have to adapt  You aren t playing any of the other teams  you are playing the penguins  Adapt to them and don t pull a De Beour and be stubborn    If the Predators lose the cup this year   like the sharks before them  what will happen  Sure it will be a great accomplishment of  getting there  but is that really all they want  I hope they wake up for game   and win one  They need to win game   as well  Nashville isn t mature enough to fight back from a   game hole in my opinion and they will just get more angry which will   more penalties for them   ,What now for Nashville ,nhl

325,I think Malkin is a player who does not get enough credit  he has made     points on     series matches and     points on     playoff games  He has made over     points   times and this season he did    goals on    regular season games   Thats really good   Malkin counts      point per regular season game   Ovechkin has made      on     regular season games  Ovechkin has played two seasons more in the NHL than Malkin   That gives him a      point per game  But in the playoffs he has a point per game percents of     Malkin has        Malkin has played more playoff games than Ovechkin and maybe on a better team  But Malkin plays as an center and Ovechkin as an winger  I would say its harder to play as an center  Ovechkin has also played belong side better players than Malkin such as Backstrom and Semin  Malkin has been that player that leads the line and Ovechkin has been the player that  finishes  the line   Malkin is one of the best in NHL  I would say that he is just behind Ovechkin and Sid   ,Why Malkin is one of the best players in mid twentieth,nhl

340,Hi all  I m discovering ice hockey  so forgive the noobish question  but I don t understand why Rinne was substituted when he takes the  th goal in game     It s not like he missed some easy saves  the goal by Malkin is a beauty  and the previous goal was an own goal  Not to mention the very first goal by Gentzel which went through the hole of a needle   Also    out of   goals came from errors done by defensemen  and not the goalie   The commentator says  Gotta get Rinne out of there   Is it common practice to punish the goalie when the defense is making mistakes  Or is it just superstition that he s responsible for them having a rough time ,Why substitute Rinne after   almost unstoppable goals ,nhl

436,I m sitting here watching this game after watching the NBA finals last night  This game is leaps and bounds more interesting than the NBA game  Doesn t seem like refs control the game like NFL and NBA  The players are bitching after every play either  PLUS Nashville had that third goal that was called a save at first but then went to replay     after watching NBA and NFL games my entire life I was conditioned to expect a      minute replay discussion  They took    seconds      I was blown away  Then I came to write this    I m still baffled  Anyways for those of you who care what an outsiders opinion is  there ya go    Hell of a game   ,I normally don t watch much hockey but     ,nhl

439,During this game  finals game    a goal was scored but wasn t given right away because it appeared to be saved by the goalie  After they reviewed it upstairs it was indeed a goal   However  during the review  the game was still being played  It wasn t for about a minute of free play did the horn finally sound    My question is  had anything significant happen during that   minute  such as a penalty or a goal  would it stand  Or would they take it away because the previous goal SHOULD HAVE stopped play ,Question from a new fan,nhl

455,I don t normally EVER watch sports  I may be from Pittsburgh but I don t usually tune in unless one of our teams is doing awesome  like now  Well except tonight  Idk wtf was going on  At first  I would have chalked it up to the other team cheating somehow due to the amount of goals they were able to score in succession  but then I realize how easy it is to do that with enough effort    Idk  If worst comes to worst and the Pens end up choking and losing the whole series  I can at least take some solace in the fact that this will be the Preds  first Stanley Cup win ever  So at least they ll have something awesome to celebrate about for the first time  But what I DESPERATELY don t want to happen is related to the fans  Specifically  if the Pens lose  I hope that the Preds fans aren t a bunch of  st grade bullies and shit on the Pens and their fans for losing  It ain t right and they don t deserve that    Sorry if this post just seems like a vent  I literally just thought all of this off the top of my head  And  at the end of the day  I can at least take pride in sharing a birthday with the Pens  own Marc Andre lol,So many thoughts after tonight s Preds vs Pens game   ,nhl

460,Hockey is the best spectator sport in the world  Watching live or on TV  Doesn t matter if pros or minor league game are always a blast  However the past couple of weeks especially highlight why the NHL isn t as good or as popular as a league compared to any other league in North America   The league is soo conservative  As a Pens fan  dad grew up in Grove City PA  SHOUTOUT everyone is soo mad at Nashville for having a rowdy crowd and heckling the Pens  That s Fun  That s what you want from a crowd  Mike Millbury  who God is the worse but made a comment before game two of the Finals about Rainey and Kunitz laughing on the ice while warming up  and everyone hates Subban because he shows his personality  Lastly every teams social media is awful  Twitter is a huge tool to engage fans and no NHL teams use them properly  especially compared to NBA  Like I truly don t understand  Can someone please explain     I would describe myself as a casual fan watched about    regular seasons games of Pens and all of playoffs but only a handful of other teams  ,Why does the NHL hate Fun ,nhl

44,Or  to put it another way  how fucking embarrassing is it that you hire a supposedly better coach in Bruce Boudreau and then the guy you fired comes back the very next year with a different team and beats your ass in the first round of the fucking playoffs   I consider this to be literally the best evidence that has ever existed in the history of sports that a team made a mistake in the hiring of a new coach   To clarify  I m a Minnesotan and Wild fan and god damned disgusted by this  And after the series  end  a series where St  Louis won   games to     the Wild s new head coach Bruce Boudreau says the Blues  weren t the better team       Fuck off Boudreau  Even if you are right that the Blues weren t the better team  that just reinforces the fact that you did an extremely shitty job of coaching in this series   Why the fuck do you fire a decent coach if you re going to replace him with a coach who has built his NHL coaching reputation over    years on having teams that play well in the regular season and choke in the post season  I m not saying they shouldn t have fired Yeo  because there were problems  but you only fire him if you know the replacement is better   Like I said  I think there s a strong argument for calling this the clearest evidence in the history of sports of a failed coaching hire ,Is there a precedent in sports for the situation between the St  Louis Blues and Minnesota Wild where a head coach    Mike Yeo    ousts his former team from the playoffs in the first year after they fired him ,nhl

64,Hey all   in tonight s Leafs vs  Caps game  the Leafs went on a power play at       so with    seconds left   Box Score      According to the  Rule Book    on page     it says        Overtime   Regular season   Penalties   When regulation time ends and the teams are   on    teams will start overtime   on    Once player strength reaches   on   or   on    at the next stoppage of play  player strength is adjusted to   on   or   on    as appropriate    It does not say anything about in the playoffs if it carries over into the overtime  but it also doesn t say anything about it not  so I am assuming it is the same rule where it does carry over  In the game tonight  NBCSN did not say anything about a power play at the start of OT    Did the Leafs get screwed or did NBCSN just not show the power play clock and I missed counted ,Question about the overtime penalty in tonight s Leafs vs  Caps game ,nhl

217,So today I decided to redesign the NHL  Totally for fun  I m sure there would be problems with this if it was actually put into place  but this is essentially what I would like to see  Here it is      Details        I cut it to    teams  I removed eleven teams and added four  mostly in Canada  I don t mean to offend you if you re a  for example  Coyotes fan  but I simply think franchises would do better in other places          Some teams  such as Washington  I wasn t sure about cutting  since they do have a fan base and aren t on the edge of collapsing or anything  But I think fewer teams is better  as it makes the league more competitive  Again  this is just fantasy          I largely retained the teams in the markets that have more of a hockey fan base  I know there s hockey fans in  e g  Florida  but if I m cutting teams  states like Minnesota have a much higher population of big hockey fans  Therefore  the distribution is disproportionately weighted on the North and Northeast  There are    Canadian teams  just under half the league  I did attempt to keep at least one team in each region  that s why the Avalanche are still around  so that if there s a die hard fan in the western US  there s a team to cheer for         I removed the first round of the playoffs  This makes the post season shorter and a playoff spot more competitive  I also didn t have a prerequisite of the top team of each division or anything  just the four best teams in each conference  If that means four Pacific teams and no Central teams  or vice versa  so be it      Again  this is just for fun  I don t mean to insult the fans of any teams I removed    I just wanted to imagine a smaller  more competitive league  This allows rivals to play more often  the top talent to have to fight a little more for a spot  etc     Feel free to critique  and interact  What do you think  Which expansion teams would you cheer for      Two Side notes       If anyone is creative with design  I d enjoy people s interpretations of logos and jerseys for the four new teams        The other idea I had is for two leagues  a Canadian League and American league  Each would have its own championship and then those two champions play for a continental championship  I may put together a fantasy league like this in the future as well ,Fantasy NHL Redesign,nhl

244,The whole point of having a draft lottery is to prevent a team from tanking so they it will then get the first overall pic  as the Devils accused the Penguins of such   in the    draft  Mario Lemieux  the last draft w o a lottery  Being this is an expansion year  the new team   Las Vegas  should have drafted first   Duh  Quite obvious  The expansion teams in the past were afforded that and there is certainly no reason for them to enter an Anti tanking lottery  when they have yet to play  The lottery should have involved only the  nd pick   onward   not the first  Major brain cramp by the league,NHL Screwed up the Draft order,nhl

246,I understand that when goaltender interference is determined by video review  it only affects the goal no goal call and no penalty is to be assessed  However  I ve seen refs wave off goals due to goaltender interference on the ice but not assess a penalty   Rule      of the NHL rulebook states    In all cases in which an attacking player initiates intentional or deliberate contact with a goalkeeper  whether or not the goalkeeper is inside or outside the goal crease  and whether or not a goal is scored  the attacking player will receive a penalty  minor or major  as the Referee deems appropriate    So how can there be no goal due to goaltender interference without an accompanying penalty ,Rule clarification  Goaltender interference,nhl
249,As a Caps fan  it might be easy to be happy Crosby missed most of last night s game and hope he won t be back for game four  but nobody wants to win that way  It cheapens any victory  I hope he s OK and will be back tomorrow night    To me  the whole difference between games     and game   was that Braden Holtby was on his game last night  where he had been clearly off in the first two games  When he is on  those odd man rushes and missed assignments by the defense result in great saves rather than bad goals  Even the two late goals the Pens got in game   both went in deflected off Caps players  I don t think you can blame Holtby for either of them   I know people will argue  but that s my feeling  Holtby s play is what is going to determine the rest of this series  whether Crosby comes back or not ,The real question in Caps Pens series is not whether Crosby comes back  it s whether Holtby continues to play like he did last night ,nhl
263,Can someone better explain how protecting exposing RFA s will work  As I understand it  if a team leaves an RFA exposed  Vegas can pick him  They then offer them a qualifying offer and if they reject it and go back to their original team and that team matches the offer  they owe Vegas a pick right    Example  unrealistic but just for explaining purposes      Tampa leaves Drouin exposed without having offered him a qualifying offer     Vegas picks Drouin  receives his rights    Vegas offers him           m    Drouin goes back to Tampa  they offer him     m  he accepts with Tampa    Tampa now has to give Vegas a first round pick    Is that how it all works ,How does RFA signings and the expansion draft work fully ,nhl

303,So your team just burned their coach s challenge and   minutes later another goal is scored against you  but the opposition was clearly off side by   meters    In the next period your goalie gets totally bowled over by an opposing forward right before the opposition shoots the puck into the net  It s blatant goaltender interference  but it doesn t matter because you ve already burned your coach s challenge   So if the officials are incompetent or if they favor the other team  you re screwed    I m really at a loss for words that we don t hear more negative comments regarding the coach s challenge    I d really appreciate it if someone could help me understand how or why it got implemented in the first place  because it makes no sense to me   Whenever a goal is scored shouldn t everything be reviewed automatically  I m sure there are some people here who can remember when and why instant replay was first implemented  I think it had been around for      years when I was born   If plays can t be reviewed to make sure that the right calls were made there s absolutely no point in having instant replay in the middle of the game , rant  Why the NHL needs to get rid of the coach s challenge ,nhl

19,As entertaining as the shootout can be  you often hear that it s not a good way to determine the outcome of a game because it s just a skills competition  That got me thinking  Even if it is just a skills competition  as long as the good teams are good at the shootout and vice versa  would that still not be a reasonable way to determine the outcome of a game  And is four on four overtime any better   I used data from the         season to the         season and looked at how teams fare in both categories  I plotted the teams winning percentage in games that end in regulation vs their winning percentage in the shootout as well as overtime   I just realised that the last season of my data uses   on   OT rather than   on    but I doubt that it would change the results very much   Anyway on a scale from    to    it looks like there is a correlation of        between a team s regulation W  and their OT W   pretty weak  and a correlation of         between a team s regulation W  and their shootout W    So both of them are pretty weak  but the shootout has a correlation which is weaker by almost a factor of      Note that I didn t do any analysis looking at what correlation you would expect just by chance alone  And I don t even know what would be the ideal correlation between the regular game and the way a tie is decided  I assume you d want at least a bit    Anyway  make of this what you will  Just thought that I should at least tell someone and this may be a good way of doing that,Overtime vs Shootout to decide a game,nhl

167,Dear Mr  Bettman    Like many Canadians I am a passionate supporter of the NHL  I grew up watching hockey with my grandfather and have many memories of going to games with him    I watched as the London Knights won the memorial cup  even though I was a Guelph Storm fan  and followed players like Drew Doughty and Dan Giradi as their careers progressed to the big leagues  When I moved to Toronto I became a Maple Leafs fan  immersing myself in the great hockey culture we have here  often phoning home to have heated debates with my poppa who remained a Habs supporter til the day he died    Apart from those conversations I found myself talking to Habs  Oiler and Sens fan everytime I braved the cold in search of a beer and hockey  As a Canadian  walking into every bar you re bound to find a hockey fan or       I watched the      Olympics in Thailand  where on a beach a million miles away from home I found myself amongst Canadians  who had travelled far to be far away from the cold  but all managed to be united in the joys of home by watching our teams skate around the ice    Mr  Bettman I am curious to know which       of Canadians you polled to get your results  What questions did you ask to ensure you got this answer  Because I haven t found one Canadian since you broke the news that is happy about the lack of NHL participation in the Olympics    I like many of us feel that you continue to want to line your pockets  In a period where there is no NFL or MLB  the desire to want to cash in on an open opportunity with a sports market makes sense  especially as teams near the playoff seasons    But what is hockey about if not to unite people  What is the point of watching our athletes excel here  if they can t showcase their talents at home for their family and friends  Look at Lundqvist or Leo Komarov  What about the kids who get to see their idols come home    During the Olympics it doesn t matter if   months out of the year you aren t a Penguins fan If you re a Canadian and you re watching Crosby you are damn proud that he has his roots in NS   And no one dislikes the Habs as much as I do  but I know that I was cheering along with every other person for Carey Price in         It is sad to see that the players desire to represent their countries doesn t supersede your need to fill your pockets    The amazing thing about bringing hockey to a global stage in the Olympics is that you don t have to understand the sport to want to be patriotic  As a Canadian you just fully understand that THIS IS OUR GAME  It s the one sport that unites us each and every Olympics and has us cheering as a nation    As fan s of the NHL we all rally against the other teams  We have debates in bars about our teams  We call our granddads and wind them up  We secretly cheer for Dan Girardi even though we love the leafs  But as Canadians watching on an Olympic level  we all cheer together    You have made it clear that the NHL doesn t care about its fans once again and I can tell you that this fan won t be watching a single NHL game while the Olympics are on    Signed    A disappointed fan  ,An open letter to Gary Bettman,nhl

187,I ve never liked seeing professional athletes in the Olympic games  I will be glad to see amateur players return to the sport  I think it should be college players  not professionals represented in the Olympics  I don t care about whatever league drama or politics that prompted this  Just glad to see it happen  In my opinion  it is a good thing for the sport  I haven t been excited for Olympic hockey for years  Now I m really hyped to see future potential stars get the spotlight  For anyone complaining that the amateurs will get killed  just remember the      winter Olympics when a bunch of amateur Americans beat a professional hockey team on steroids  There hasn t been an American hockey game like that since  Now we have the chance again for some real sports magic  Not some NHL players who aren t willing to go all out because they don t want to be injured for regular season and playoffs  The only memorable moment I have of Olympic hockey with professionals was the  Nagano Olympics in         I seriously doubt an incident like that would have happened if it was college kids with the opportunity of a lifetime in place of professionals who have already made it  Also I would like to point out  both the Canadian and USA teams with heavy NHL representation  Wayne Gretzky was there kids  got spanked by teams with very little NHL representation in the      Winter Olympics  So professional players doesn t necessarily make for a good team or good games  The pros have many opportunities to show themselves on the world stage  college kids have none  which Is unfair given their peers in other sports have the opportunity to play  I hope this change remains and the NHL keeps it s players out of the Olympics   Anyway that is my rant  Hopefully the rabid fanboys at least read this before this gets downvoted to hell ,Am I the only one glad to see the NHL not going to the Olympics ,nhl

308,Watching the Oilers game  an announcer said that because the Ducks clinched the Pacific there would be no Battle of Alberta in the first round but there may be in the second round but then he went on to apologize and say it would be the  rd round because of reseeding  I was confused by this and looked it up to see if there was reseeding if the wild card beat the top seed  Turns out he was wrong and maybe just confused but then I saw this   Home ice advantage through the first two rounds goes to the team that placed higher in the regular season standings  In the Conference Finals and Stanley Cup Final  home ice advantage goes to the team that had the better regular season record    regardless of the teams  final standing in their respective divisions   Does that mean  for example  if the Rangers and Canadiens traded point totals  Rangers would then have more but still be a Wild Card  would the Rangers have home ice advantage  Also  does this mean  if the Rangers win in the  st round  that they would have home ice advantage against the Senators or Bruins  It seems to read that way but during the season  while the Rangers were ahead  I would hear time and time again that  the Rangers would play on the road to start the playoffs against Montreal even though they had more points at the time ,Home ice confusion ,nhl

385,If you don t want to read the whole wall of text just skip to the TL DR at the end which will tell you what you need to know  although reading the whole thing might provide some additional input    I know Chris Pronger s departure still brings up sour memories from       We were a hair s breadth from winning the Cup that year  and even though we didn t  there initially seemed to be hope that we would be contenders for years to come  I was in Grade   when we lost and while many people were understandably sad after losing Game    there were also many hopeful sentiments and some of my friends would say stuff like  It s OK  because      is absolutely our year   And at the time  there was still reason for hope  We had barely squeaked into the playoffs as the    seed that year  but during the regular season we had been riddled with injuries and prior to the start of the season many pundits were picking us as Cup contenders so really our run wasn t that big of a surprise  But then in a period of less than a year it all fell apart   Pronger is hated in Edmonton for a number of reasons  First off  he was our anchor player at the time  While he may not have been a franchise player the way Connor McDavid is now he was certainly one of the best if not the best defencemen in the league at the time  A former Hart and Norris trophy winner  he made our power play absolutely deadly in the first three rounds of the playoffs before Carolina stymied it  With Pronger  the Oilers were a force to be reckoned with   The second reason people hated Pronger was because he was the first domino to fall in a chain of absolutely terrible departures which ultimately gutted the team and set it up for its now infamous playoff drought  After Pronger left the Oilers were no longer touted as Cup contenders for the following playoffs  but with the remainder of the team still intact they were still expected to at least make the playoffs  and perhaps make a decent if not spectacular run  Instead  the team crumbled in a matter of weeks  with Pronger s defence partner  Jaroslav Spacek leaving the team soon after to be replaced with Cory Cross  who proved to be an abominable D man during his tenure with the Oilers  Then  Michal Peca  who never really wanted to play in Edmonton in the first place  also demanded to leave  In only one year after the lockout and the creation of the new NHL  thanks to a few sparse moments of brilliance from Kevin Lowe and Craig MacTavish  the Oilers had built a Stanley Cup caliber team and after only one season it was all gone  For the diehard hockey fan  the scenario could only be described as apocalyptic and the desolation was made complete when Ryan Smyth was unexpectedly traded at the trade deadline of the         season after he and Kevin Lowe couldn t agree to a new contract  Soon enough  Lowe realized his blunder but the damage was done  The Oilers proceeded to lose their first    games following the trade  and were as a result knocked out of playoff contention that season  which would only be a harbinger of things to come  In the following   seasons  the       season was the only one in which they had even a legitimate shot of making the playoffs  and we routinely finished in the bottom three teams in the league during those years  Changing players  coaches  and general managers didn t seem to help  It seemed like we were eternally stuck   The third reason why people hate Pronger were the murky circumstances of his departure  Pronger had signed a   year deal to stay in Edmonton and both he and his wife were reportedly very happy about the trade that brought him here  But suddenly after   year  he wanted out and rumors were spreading like wildfire  At the very least it seemed  his wife was not happy  But the rumors ran far deeper than that  with one common story being that Pronger had been having an affair with a young sports reporter who routinely talked to Oilers  players in the locker room  and that this fling had resulted in a pregnancy  This story was ultimately neither confirmed nor disproved but it certainly only fueled the growing resentment  At the height of the rumors  the Pronger family ultimately went on vacation overseas  I can t remember the exact destination  but it was either Hawaii or Mexico  to escape the spotlight  So Pronger betrayed the team and many Oilers fans believe he did so in the most dishonorable circumstances  This is one of the deeper reasons why even now many fans will struggle to forgive him  even if the Oilers win the Cup   Finally  in the ultimate twist of poetic injustice  Pronger was traded to the Anaheim Ducks  where he was promptly made team captain  and won the Stanley Cup he had failed to win with the Oilers in his first season playing there  Even from a completely neutral standpoint this could not have been more unfair  He had brought great promise to a team that had been routinely eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Dallas Stars for most of the preceding decade after basking in its glory days and there was real hope he would bring some of that back  Instead not only did he fail to do so  but he also messed up mightily and ended up getting rewarded for it while the Oilers as a team ended up completely desolated  I think many hockey fans in other cities never fully understood why Pronger was booed in Edmonton for the rest of his career whenever he touched the puck and why even now  with his career over  with him being in the Hall of Fame  and with the Oilers back in the playoffs  many fans  myself included still dislike him  Well  now you know   TL DR  People hate Pronger because    He was the Oilers  best player and nobody expected him to leave    His departure set the stage for other players to leave ultimately causing the long playoff drought    There were rumors that he left because he knocked up a locker room reporter and it was the only way he could save his marriage     He still won the Cup the following year while the Oilers languished in misery ,A few things you might not have known about the Chris Pronger Oilers debacle,nhl

3,I ll start by saying my family is born and raised in Pittsburgh  so they re die hard fans of every Pittsburgh team  Before yesterday  I ve only watched   NHL games  on television  Yesterday I attended the Penguins   Redwings game in Pittsburgh  and it was literally the best sports experience I ve ever had  I ve been to several Steelers and Pirates games  and those don t even compare to the atmosphere of a Hockey game   I m not sure if it s because I had center seats directly on the glass or not  but it COULD NOT have been better  I should have probably started with this  but I had absolutely no idea about hockey before yesterday  No rules  penaltys  anything  The only thing I knew was Sidney Crosby was allegedly a beast on ice  Yesterday they celebrated Crosbys achievement of      goals  and the whole stadium just seemed to be part of the same family  I learned so much from yesterday  about the players  how to dress so you re not cold throughout the game  that players give pucks away over the glass  and pretty much how to have fun  as odd as that sounds   The first period I m in my seat being quiet  observing      scored to make it     red wings  and I didn t say anything but clap  Once the third period started and we scored again  I m screaming at the top of my lungs  excited as hell  I didn t care that we were down by     I mean I did but whatever  we lost  but that didn t even matter at the end to me    Glad to finally understand why NHL is one of the best sports to watch  and I fully intend to watch every possible game I can from now on    Rants over  if it sounds like I don t know what I m talking about  I apologize  I technically still don t know as much as I should  but fully intend on learning    Picture from the game   not a good picture  just one of the few I took because I was too into observing  and I was focused on talking a picture of Hornqvist    ,First hockey game last night  I m hooked ,nhl

7,Ok so here me out here folks  I know Matthews to some is the second coming of Gretzky    The stats   Marner  GP     G     P    Mathews  GP     G     P      The key thing I m missing here however  is I haven t watched many Leafs games  and when I have  my attention was always on Matthews  If a Leafs fan could comment on the defensive end of both players  that would be helpful    Why Marner isn t mentioned often in the Calder talk  when at the beginning of the season he was considered a big IF when it came to making the team is beyond me  For most of the season  he s lead the leafs in scoring  and he s legitimately competing with Matthews for the Toronto scoring title  ,Controversial opinion  Mitch Marner is a better player than Auston Matthews,nhl
8,Capitals fan here  have been my whole life  And yes  I know the Capitals choke every year and I m well accustomed to it  However  I do find it ridiculous how the playoff matchups are set up  Last year  the   best teams in the NHL played each other in the ECSF     WSH and    PIT  while the    NYI played    TBL  I know that they want  besides WC teams  the metro side to play out and play the winner of the atlantic side in the ECF  But doesn t that seem ridiculous  The Capitals and Penguins were by far the best   teams in the league last year  and they ended up playing each other in the second round   And with the Metro having   of the top   teams right now  it seems very likely that we will have the same problem this year  My suggestion would be to do matchups by straight up seeding  We can still have the top   from each division and   WC teams  But once the   teams are set     plays        plays        plays    and so on  Then if both the    and    teams win out  they play each other in the ECF and WCF  Am I crazy for thinking that makes sense ,NHL should adjust playoff matchup rules,nhl
9,Am I the only one that doesn t like how the NHL awards points in the standings   I have always thought this  and then last year when the Bruins  my favorite team  didn t make the playoffs when they had more wins than both the Red Wings and the Flyers who did make the playoffs  that solidified it for me   My suggestion would be to either just have the standings go by number of wins or do   points for a regulation win    points for an overtime SO win    point for an overtime shootout loss  and   points for a regulation loss   Before I get any hate  I know this system would both hurt and help the Bruins based on different seasons  but it just seems like this makes the most sense to me ,Should the NHL change the points system they use for the standings ,nhl

135,Hey guys I wanna hear what you guys think about a double elimination format  For those who don t know here s how it works   There are essentially two brackets  A losers and winners  Teams in winners bracket receive two chances to stay alive in a tournament  Once they lose match in winners bracket they will be placed in losers bracket  Teams in losers bracket don t receive second chances  Once they loose a match in losers bracket they are eliminated from the tournament   So here s my format idea   Top   Teams automatically qualify for WB  Teams      qualify for LB  Format for respective bracket would go accordingly                                                   Round   would go like this  Team that loses their series in LB are eliminated  Teams that loose in WB will go on to face winners of LB teams  LB teams in the second round will face the the teams from WB with highest seed playing lowest seed and so on   Example   R    Winners Bracket Quarter Finals                                                              Teams seeded         are knocked in to LB Round    Loser Bracket Round                                                                       Teams seeded                are eliminated from contention    R     Winners Bracket Semi Final                                 Teams seeded      are knocked into LB Quarter Finals  Losers Bracket Round                                                                     Teams seeded               are eliminated form contention    R     Winners Bracket Final                 Team seeded    is knocked into LB finals   Losers Bracket Round                                     R    Losers Bracket Quarter Final                                Teams seeded      are eliminated from contention   R    Losers Bracket Semi Final                  Team seeded    is Eliminated form Contention   R    Losers Bracket Finals                   Team seeded    is Eliminated form contention   R    Stanley Cup Finals                                 Note that the LB team must win   series in order to clinch win Stanley Cup while the team from WB only need to win   series due to WB advantage   This format has a total of    series     if WB team won first series  while the current format only has     I think that this would create much more parody in the Playoffs because it gives teams a second chance to make a run in Losers Bracket  Yes some of you may realize this format is from e sports and we ve seen teams make LB runs and my god is it fun to watch  I think this is good all in all because there s more hockey for us to watch   Also for those who are planning to rip me in the comments please don t  this is just and idea and I want the best for this sport just like you do  I ve loved hockey my whole life ,Double Elimination format idea for the Stanley Cup Playoffs,nhl

274,Sorry in advance  I ve scrolled through the first few pages and seen a few of these threads  I ve recently got into NHL and need a team to root for rather then just watching random games like I have been doing so I was hoping that someone can give me a few teams that fall into this category that I ve described  Then i can watch a few games from the teams and see who I have a connection with and go from there  I m from the UK so I want a team that s on the east coast with the time differences and all that  I don t want to be classed as a bandwagoner so I need a team that are not the best but aren t terrible  Maybe a team that hasn t had much success in recent years but is usually in and around the play offs each year  Thanks in advance,Another one of those who to support threads,nhl

304,Let me start off by saying that I think that Las Vegas is a terrible choice for a new NHL team  There are no other major  NBA  NFL  MLB  sports teams in Vegas  it s not a popular sport in Nevada and the demographics of Las Vegas  irregular work schedules  high dependence on tourism  all combine to make the  Golden Knights  a dreadful choice for a franchise  But aside from that  the very name  Golden Knights  is atrocious  First of all  the US Army will not allow the name to be used  since  Golden Knights  is already the name of a parachute division  Here s a simple suggestion  the Las Vegas Vipers  It is geographically appropriate  since Rattlesnakes are common in Nevada  it has an assonance with the letter  V   and it has the potential for an appealing logo  If the NHL wants to start a franchise that is likely doomed to fail  they could at least give it a worthwhile name,Opinion on the Vegas team name,nhl

368,With the recent announcement of the  horrid  Barlcays Center killing its deal with the Islanders and the Nassau Coliseum s renovation cutting its capacity down to sub   k people  not NHL ready   it seems the Islanders might be on the move  The only thing stopping a move is if they can build a new arena in Queens Flushing  which seems unlikely considering the NY area sports teams have all received new arenas in the past   years  except for MSG  which received a     B makeover  which is like new stadium money  involving all major boroughs except for SI  There would be way too many venues for the market to handle  The city and citizens can t deal with any new stadiums at this point  If the Islanders are to be relocated  here are the major options ranked in my opinion      Quebec City  QB  The cream of the crop  Brand new NHL ready arena in the Videotron Centre and an extremely passionate fanbase thats craving for a hockey team  Very profitable for the owners that choose to move there  I bet  if anything  this should be the best  Quebec has died to get their Nordiques back  and the Islanders may be the best chance yet  Odds          Kansas City  MO  The city has proven time and time again that it has some of the best sports fans in America  They also have the NHL ready Sprint Center  Issues come with its small market size and sharing the same state as the St  Louis Blues  who own nearly all of Missouri s hockey fanbase  but could lead to a rivalry  Otherwise  KC could be a rock solid bet for hockey  Odds          Seattle  WA  Very passionate fanbase for most of their sports  No major indoor sports in the city and can embrace the team like they did the Supersonics  Plus this would align the conferences  Only issue comes with regards to a stadium  as the Key Arena is not suitable for a professional team at this point  Either major renovations are needed or a new arena is needed  which could be difficult considering the city has been very ho hum on that  Odds         Cleveland  OH  Very passionate fanbases  a huge amount of support for their own AHL Monsters   nd in the AHL   and Quicken Loans Arena  which is slated for renovations as well  lead Cleveland to be a solid market  However  the market could be oversaturated  which would make Cleveland a four team city  which it is simply not  Interesting  but interest from the city is hit or miss  Odds         Hartford  CT  This move could work due to Hartford s hockey history and the Islanders fanbase would not be isolated  meaning those who supported the team will not necessarily be completely shunned  However  hockey failed in Hartford once  the market is easily the smallest out of all listed   and the XL Center needs major renovations  Additionally  centralizing keeping a bunch of teams in the north east may hurt the NHL in the long run  This move has a shot  but a very small one  Odds      Honorable Mentions Odds      Atlanta  GA  It failed twice  It won t work again  The NHL learned its lesson  Hamilton  ON  Adding even more teams to Ontario seems far fetched  Houston  TX  Hockey in the dirty south hasn t worked all too well  see the Coyotes and the Stars   Another attempt seems very idiotic  despite Houston s massive market  Milwaukee  Wi  Too small a market with too many teams  despite a new arena in the works to replace the Bradley Center  Also  the city is extremely close to Chicago  bringing competition from the  Hawks  Saskatoon  SK  Good market with no teams in Saskatchewan  but fans might be unproven and major arena issues arise   Let me know what you guys all think ,NY Islanders Relocation Possibilities ,nhl

442,It was an illegal hit worth getting ejected from the game  yet a   minute penalty and no further action will suffice  Here s the hit if you missed it    I knew the NHL wouldn t suspend Malkin  but it s embarrassing how they go out of their way to protect their star players  Vermette got a    game suspension for hitting a ref on the leg yet when a star player leaves his feet and makes primary contact with the head using his elbow  DoPS is nowhere to be seen  Malkin has a record of dirty plays yet he s protected because of his status  And don t bring up Buff because I also agree his hit was dirty ,Thoughts on Malkin not facing disciplinary action,nhl

76,My family decided to see a NHL game today  and I decided on a whim to go just to check it out  I have never watched a hockey game before  and I am not a big sports fan  Unfortunately  I didn t like it for some reasons     As someone who doesn t watch hockey sports  I didn t really understand what was going on  I thought an announcer was standard for sports game  It s been years since my last high school football game  but I remember an announcer being there    The constant interruptions with advertising  I understand people have to take breaks from the action  but I thought the constant streams of advertisements were incredibly annoying  and I think it would really ruin my experience even if I did like hockey  if not more  There were also really bright LED lighting advertisements  often in red  in my peripheral vision that were also very distracting  I feel like this would be a disappointment after paying     for tickets  How do you guys deal with it    There was this really annoying lady behind me who was constantly complaining  saying the players were  playing like bitches  even though she probably never had played a game of hockey in her life  I found it pretty disrespectful    One of the breaks ended up honoring some guy who had served time in the army  I find the association between professional sports and the military a little creepy and weird    Personally  I guess NHL games are not for me  I would not recommend it for people who are unfamiliar with hockey or not big sports fans  I m curious for you guys who enjoy going to see live hockey games  why you enjoy the experience so much  Or do some fans have similar reservations about buying tickets ,I saw my first NHL game as someone who s never watched hockey,nhl
78,Ok I m a Bruins fan and would like to bring up the Buffalo vs Boston game  Will Carrier hit David Backes in front of the Bruins bench  This post isn t about the hit but the Refs stepping in to a fight that they squashed immediately that was suppose to be a message of  unwritten rules  that fighting helps keep from happening  Again in the same game  McQuaid went after the player in a  in my opinion  bullshit glove drop but here s were the NHL endangered McQuaid  They stopped McQuaid from fighting back allowing the other guy   straight punches to his face  resulting in bloodshed   This is bullshit  No one asked for less fights in hockey  Polls have the approval of fighting almost     yes   So what s the deal  Are players just going to be allowed to make dangerous hits without misconducts and at the same time heavily penalize teammates for sticking up for the injured player  Should we wait for a superstar to get an elbow to the face to realize the enforcment of fighting actually helps make the player think twice about that illegal hit  I m gonna watch hockey still and nothing changes but this really makes me question the path the NHL has taken in player safety by shutting down the one thing that kept assholes from making illegal hits  ,NHL Referee involvement in fights,nhl

133, Pictures from the game     Growing up in Minnesota  I ve always been a hockey fan  but during my freshman year of high school I was watching the playoffs between Dallas  our old team   and New Jersey and was absolutely mesmerized by Martin Brodeur  Goalies have always grabbed my interest  I loved to watch Roy and Hasek  and I became utterly obsessed with watching him play ever since  I made a large painting of him in art class which has been hanging up in my living room for the last    years  Unfortunately it took some abuse a few years ago but it is still in decent condition    One of my lifelong dreams was to see him play  I was never able to  quite get the logistics to work and when he retired I was devastated  So imagine my delight when I heard he would be playing in the winter classic alumni game       was a life changing year for me in several ways and I refused to miss out on this opportunity  I got my tickets  booked a flight and flew down this past weekend  Just seeing him in his gear  albeit not red  black and white was a little weird    on the ice and listening to the national anthem was such a powerful moment for me    When the third period rolled around and he finally got to play  I was ecstatic  Seeing him  in person  between the pipes  was just an unforgettable experience  His skill was blatantly obvious even in an alumni game  With   minutes left  my cousin  who lives in St  Louis and is also a huge hockey fan  and I booked it to the lower level and other side of the stadium so we could see him even better and possibly get close to watch him go inside  When the game ended and he made his way into the stadium  it was almost overwhelming  I will never get over being    feet away from someone I have loved to watch play since I was     Quite literally one of the best days of my life  ,I had a dream come true watching Brodeur play in the Winter Classic Alumni game on NYE,nhl

318,It is really crazy how much parity the NHL has  and parity is GREAT its not that  its really cool how ridiculously close this league is  If we look at things  theres only   teams from western conference that appears to have lost their chance of a playoff spot  unless they play really well for the last half of the season  those two teams are Avalanche and Coyotes  Outside that  ALL teams from the west and ALL teams from the east are only a few wins shy of a playoff spot  Thats absolutely crazy to think about  That SO many teams are still in the mix  I think thats good   But i also think the point system needs to be changed to a   point system like we see in the olympics and at the world cup  Theres much less parity on the national teams than in NHL so it doesnt even make sense to have the   point system there  but i still think its a great system that i think would compliment the NHL and make it even more exciting   If you dont know  im sure most of u do  you get   points for winning a game now    for losing  and each team are awarded   point if the game goes to OT in which the winner will recieve an additional point  This currently means  theres no difference between winning in OT and between getting things done in regulation  I think thats pretty bad  The only difference is that the opponent walks away with a point as well  but in most and many cases thats completely irrelevant  With the   point system you get   points for winning in regulation time    for winning in overtime    for losing in overtime  and   points for losing in regulation time  I think thats a great system  I wish there was an incentive to go for the win in regular time rather than accepting the game going to OT just to secure that   point first and foremost  i think this would be really nice to see and i think it would benefit the league as well  It would also be great to see the teams that are behind in the standings will now chase the win in regulation time and they will  risk it all  to get things done in regulation to get that extra point  thats gonna be nice and will create some exciting games  and maybe this approach will pay off and will eventually push you ahead of the teams that are just playing it safe so to speak by being okay with grabbing just the   point in most of their games  I just think a   point system would suit and compliment this current league we have now much more  its almost as if that system is taylor made for the NHL   What do you guys think of a   point system in the NHL ,The NHL has so much parity   should the system be changed to a   point system ,nhl

53,My dad loves the Dallas Cowboys  It s not simply because he likes the way they play or thinks they have a strong team  He likes them because he grew up watching the Cowboys his entire life  He has a deeply emotional and personal connection to the team   Not really being a fan of sports other than hockey   and even then  I m just a casual fan   I don t have that same connection to any sports team  I love the Predators  but part of that is just that they re the local team  well  I guess the Blues are  too   If I were to deeply invest in watching hockey as a hobby  the team I would like the most would be the team I enjoy watching the most  Having little viewing experience  my favorite teams are the Preds and the Sharks at the moment   But I do feel like I m missing out on something because I m not deeply connected to a team  My dad gets really passionate when watching the Cowboys play  but when I watch the Predators play  I watch it more like a movie than as a lifelong fan  I obviously cheer when they score  but I don t get super pissed off when they lose or hold any hatred towards any of their rivals  That seems good to an extent  but I do feel like I m not getting as strong of an experience as I would if I had been a passionate Predators fan since I moved to Tennessee as a kid   For those of you who do have that close connection to a team or teams  how important is that to you  Does it enhance the viewing experience in any way  Does it have drawbacks  And for those who are sorta in my position  do you feel like you re missing out on something when you watch hockey ,When it comes to being a hockey  or sports  fan  how important is a personal connection to a team ,nhl

81,I m reading how some teams have too many goalies or not enough this or that  And the expansion draft seems like a mystery to everyone   So I ll toss this question into the mix    Could an NHL team that has a third year player who isn t a star  but a decent man on the roster  temporarily demote him to the AHL affiliate to protect him from the expansion draft for Vegas   It s probably too slick  or likely based on the contracts of the players  so I doubt it  But it would be an intriguing strategy to limit the players that are eligible for selection ,Protect players in expansion draft by  demoting  them to AHL ,nhl

210,On Nolan Patrick s sports hernia injury issue   Patrick played through the final weeks of his         campaign with a sports hernia that required immediate surgery  While I commend him for having the courage to play through the injury  evidently it was an issue that bothered him  it could also have potential long term effects  My assessment of his game factors in mostly matches played before the hernia  During the second half of last season  there was a debate about whether Pierre Luc Dubois was a better prospect than Patrick  The consensus appears to have been that Patrick would have been ranked  th to   th in last year s draft  Healthy or not  he still does not display the kind of dynamic offensive ability or creativity that a bona fide first line center is expected to possess         McKenzie s pre season ranking  The  Nolan Patrick Draft      By Bob McKenzie   Sep            Former Wheat King head coach and general manager Kelly McCrimmon  who is now assistant general manager of the NHL expansion team in Las Vegas  which begins play next season and will have the third best odds in the      draft lottery and pick no lower than sixth overall  fervently believes Patrick has what it takes to be a No    centre in the NHL    While some of the scouts surveyed by TSN do not discount Patrick evolving into that role  the consensus view is Patrick is projected more as a second line NHL centre and doesn t have the same  wow  factor as McDavid  Eichel and Matthews     He s going to be a good  maybe very good  NHL player   one scout said   but he isn t a dynamic player  His skating isn t bad but he s not dynamic like those others  McDavid  Eichel and Matthews            Patrick s birthday is Sept      so he was just four days off being eligible for last season s draft  Had he been available last June  where would he slot amongst the best players of a very strong draft class  like Matthews  Patrik Laine  Jesse Puljujarvi and Pierre Luc Dubois  among others    The consensus amongst scouts surveyed by TSN is that Patrick wouldn t have displaced any of the top four picks in last year s draft  Depending on the scout  they retroactively rank Patrick anywhere between No    and     based on his         season                After a long season  an even longer one awaits Nolan Patrick          NHL draft eligible Nolan Patrick  excited for the chance at winning the MasterCard Memorial Cup at such a young age  and with such a great group of guys in Brandon    Damien Cox May                PM         Here at the MasterCard Memorial Cup  however  by his own admission  Patrick was  average at best   and so were the Wheat Kings  who crashed and burned with three straight losses to be the first team eliminated          Older players like Ivan Provorov  captain Macoy Erkamps  Tim McGauley and John Quenneville were supposed to lead this Brandon team in this tournament  not the    year old Patrick  But none played particularly well  although Quenneville scored a spectacular between the legs goal early in the tournament against Rouyn Noranda    Still  there was a lot of focus on Patrick  and he wasn t able to score at all in the tournament or assert himself in any of the games  ending up with just one assist and    shots in three games for a Brandon team that only scored five goals in the tournament  Patrick seemed uncertain at times  not surprising in an event where much older players usually dominate          With the injury  he became entirely ineffective  It has also opened the door to other concerns          Wheat Kings star Patrick  getting close  to returning to WHL champions     By  Mike Sawatzky   Posted                  AM   Last Modified                  AM         Patrick was injured in Brandon s     win over the Red Deer Rebels in Game   of the WHL s Eastern Conference final April     He registered two assists in that game and then  two nights later  fired a hat trick and added two helpers as the Wheat Kings clinched a berth in the league final with a     win in Game      How s that for playing hurt    He apparently hid the pain in his abdomen exceptionally well          Patrick admits he had no sense of how serious the injury was but had no interest in sitting out     I was in quite a bit of pain   he said   It happened in Game   of the Red Deer series  Then  I kinda played through it during the league final  It s kinda tough to say no to playing     After the season was over  Patrick took a two week break before returning to off season workouts  When the injury showed no improvement  he consulted with doctors who diagnosed the problem and said a surgical repair was necessary    For some  it s the sort of situation that triggers a debate about how much is too much          One has to wonder if playing through a sports hernia will have any lasting effects on his career  Not only did he play through it  but he ran into complications with it early this season               Draft  Nolan Patrick out with upper body injury     A rated prospect considered day to day  will be re evaluated Saturday   by Mike G  Morreale  mikemorrealeNHL   NHL com Staff Writer   October   th         Brandon center Nolan Patrick  a candidate to be the first pick of the      NHL Draft  is day to day because of an upper body injury  a team spokesman said Friday    Patrick  an A rated skater on NHL Central Scouting s preliminary players to watch list  is out against Prince Albert at Westman Place in Brandon  Manitoba  on Friday  He will be re evaluated Saturday  when Brandon is scheduled to play at Prince Albert                     Draft  Nolan Patrick out     more weeks     Projected top pick remains sidelined with upper body injury sustained six games into Western Hockey League season   by Mike G  Morreale  mikemorrealeNHL   NHL com Staff Writer   November   th                 I m skating on my own right now   Patrick said   I just starting getting back on the ice  this week  and doing edge work and skill stuff like that  but nothing too intense yet  Every day it gets a little better  so I m hopeful  This was out of my control  and it s killing me not to be out there with my teammates     Dan Marr  the director of NHL Central Scouting  believes recovery from this type of condition has no set timeline     The condition is unfortunate in that it occurred during Patrick s draft year  but it really doesn t influence his draft status as NHL clubs know him very well as a player and he ll remain one of the top draft prospects for        Marr said   It s expected that Nolan will fully recover  and NHL teams know that this type of injury often has no predictable timeline  He ll be ready when he s ready            It was a combination of maybe coming back to early and overcompensating a bit   Patrick said   My muscles weren t really training to move how they re supposed to after the surgery  I think I was still tight in certain areas and so I was overcompensating     It s a matter of training the muscles on how they should function           Two prominent NHL players who played through sports hernias during the         Stanley Cup Playoffs are Andrew Ladd and Ryan Getzlaf  One can argue that neither of them have looked the same since then  Ladd s was more severe  requiring off season surgery          Sports Hernia Recovery Could Be Hurting Andrew Ladd     The Jets captain has struggled mightily this season  Could it be due to the lingering effects of the sports hernia surgery he underwent in the offseason  How have other star players looked after the procedure    by JacobStoller Jan               am EST   Andrew Ladd hasn t been the same this year  He hasn t been one of the Jets best players  night in and night out  His poor play is coming at the worst of times for him and for Jets management  With the trade deadline just over a month away  the pending UFA remains unsigned  For a player that is trying to earn a new contract  you d expect to see a lot more than what Andrew Ladd has brought to the table    While Ladd is asking for a long term extension  reportedly around   years  in contract negotiations  his performance isn t pleading his case very well  Yes  on the last few scoresheets Ladd has put a Band Aid over his disappointing season  He has   assists in his last   contests  but has been held without a goal for the last    games  It s not like Ladd hasn t been the same for just spurts of this season  Ladd hasn t been himself for a little while  dating back to the end of last season    Last year in the Jets first round playoff series against the Anaheim Ducks  Ladd was widely criticized for his performance  He looked sluggish and banged up  and was practically invisible most of the games    Something was evidently not right with the Jets captain  It was revealed after the series that Ladd had suffered a sports hernia and was playing through it during the last part of the season  Since around that point  Ladd s production has taken a significant drop off  Could his struggles be due to lingering effects from the sports hernia surgery he s recovering from          According to a study done by the American Journal of Sports Medicine  players who have played over   full seasons  Ladd has    in the NHL under his belt  return from sports hernia injuries with a significant decrease in their overall performance levels          Another example  Ladd s junior teammate Ryan Getzlaf  also had a sports hernia at the end of last season  He did not need surgery  but the effects of the injury are taking a huge toll on his production as well  Getzlaf is a surefire NHL superstar and has been amongst the best in the league over the last couple of years  He has   goals so far this season  He s on pace for under       Both Ladd and Getzlaf have played well over   seasons in the NHL  and both are fitting into the criteria of veteran players having production drop offs after suffering a sports hernia          Many consider Patrick to be a future second line center in the NHL on the condition that he is entirely healthy  but a problematic sports hernia might be another concern  Some players return and are fine  but Nolan hasn t even been drafted yet and has mishandled his injury  To spend several weeks active and in pain with a sports hernia is a serious mistake  Apparently  he didn t tell anyone about it  although his on ice performance spoke volumes  furthermore  he has missed a significant part of the current season with complications          Sports Hernia       years ago  by John Read          Sports hernia  is a condition of   chronic   exercise related supra inguinal groin pain which is associated with an incipient direct bulge of the inguinal wall whenever the abdominal muscles contract forcefully    This limits athletic performance and can be a  career ending  injury            Symptoms   Sports that are most often affected involve kicking and or rapid acceleration with an accompanying sudden change in direction  e g  soccer  rugby  AFL  ice hockey  martial arts   The pain develops during exercise  is generally unilateral but occasionally bilateral  and is typically located in the supra inguinal portion of lower abdomen lateral to rectus abdominis  sometimes radiating to the testis  Fig    solid arrows   Importantly  it does not reach the pelvic midline  but can often radiate into the medial thigh along the path of adductor longus  Fig    dotted arrows     Sports hernia pain is often aggravated by sudden acceleration  twisting and turning  cutting and kicking  coughing and or sneezing  and sit ups    The pain generally persists after a game  with accompanying stiffness and difficulty getting out of bed the following day  In most cases  the initial onset is insidious  However  in about one third of cases  the patient recalls a sudden  tearing  sensation at the time of initial symptom onset        Despite any period of rest or lay off  Sports hernia pain returns immediately and with full force upon resumption of sport      Physical findings   The overwhelming majority of patients are young adult males  Objective physical examination findings are typically sparse  A palpable cough impulse is either weak or absent  A subtle bulge in skin surface contour can occasionally be seen over the affected inguinal region when observed from above with the patient standing  Pain may be evoked with a resisted abdominal  crunch  and tenderness elicited most commonly over the conjoint tendon immediately superomedial to pubic tubercle  Many patients also exhibit tenderness over the ipsilateral adductor longus origin and or have a positive adductor  squeeze  test in bent knee position  pain and inhibition when asked to squeeze the legs together against resistance           Some first hand comments about sports hernias from HF Boards posters        Originally Posted by tortoise    This type of injury if not properly treated will be a chronic issue in

Originally Posted by tarheelhockey    I had a double hernia and was fine without surgery  Basically what the doctor said was that you can be more certain of avoiding complications through surgery  but most people can live and play sports without treatment  If you are only experiencing a bit of tenderness and a small bulge  there is nothing to be seriously concerned about  If it becomes aggravated and requires surgery  you will know by the sudden increase in pain and should go to the hospital IMMEDIATELY     After a couple weeks the swelling went down and life was back to normal  Definitely take it easy  though  you don t want to make matters any worse by pushing yourself  Hockey in particular tends to cause sports hernias  so you absolutely want to stay off skates until you feel back to

condition has no set timeline     The condition is unfortunate in that it occurred during Patrick s draft year  but it really doesn t influence his draft status as NHL clubs know him very well as a

supposed to after the surgery  I think I was still tight in certain areas and so I was overcompensating     It s a matter of training the muscles on how they should function           He remains

again  day to day upper body issues  relating to the sports hernia since October          to the present day            He played through it in April and May      when he needed surgery  this could have caused further problems   To spend several weeks active and in pain with a sports hernia is a serious mistake  He severely mishandled this injury  Apparently  he did not tell anyone about it  furthermore  he has missed a significant part of the current season with complications and may confront potential long term consequences         Sports Hernia       years ago  by John Read          Sports hernia  is a condition of   chronic   exercise related supra inguinal groin pain which is associated with an incipient direct bulge of the inguinal wall whenever the abdominal muscles contract forcefully    This limits athletic performance and can be a  career ending  injury            Symptoms   Sports that are most often affected involve kicking and or rapid acceleration with an accompanying sudden change in direction  e g  soccer  rugby  AFL  ice hockey  martial arts   The pain develops during exercise  is generally unilateral but occasionally bilateral  and is typically located in the supra inguinal portion of lower abdomen lateral to rectus abdominis  sometimes radiating to the testis  Fig    solid arrows   Importantly  it does not reach the pelvic midline  but can often radiate into the medial thigh along the path of adductor longus  Fig    dotted arrows     Sports hernia pain is often aggravated by sudden acceleration  twisting and turning  cutting and kicking  coughing and or sneezing  and sit ups    The pain generally persists after a game  with accompanying stiffness and difficulty getting out of bed the following day  In most cases  the initial onset is insidious  However  in about one third of cases  the patient recalls a sudden  tearing  sensation at the time of initial symptom onset        Despite any period of rest or lay off  Sports hernia pain returns immediately and with full force upon resumption of sport      Physical findings   The overwhelming majority of patients are young adult males  Objective physical examination findings are typically sparse  A palpable cough impulse is either weak or absent  A subtle bulge in skin surface contour can occasionally be seen over the affected inguinal region when observed from above with the patient standing  Pain may be evoked with a resisted abdominal  crunch  and tenderness elicited most commonly over the conjoint tendon immediately superomedial to pubic tubercle  Many patients also exhibit tenderness over the ipsilateral adductor longus origin and or have a positive adductor  squeeze  test in bent knee position  pain and inhibition when asked to squeeze the legs together against resistance           Some first hand comments about sports hernias from HF Boards posters        Originally Posted by tortoise    This type of injury if not properly treated will be a chronic issue in the future  Unlike other types of injuries where one can tough it out  this injury is debilitating  Not only is it painful but makes it virtually impossible play through    I ve had this injury reoccur for the past three seasons and it gets worst every time  At the end of the season last May I couldn t even walk upright and getting out of a bed took extra measures to lessen the pain       Originally Posted by tarheelhockey    I had a double hernia and was fine without surgery  Basically what the doctor said was that you can be more certain of avoiding complications through surgery  but most people can live and play sports without treatment  If you are only experiencing a bit of tenderness and a small bulge  there is nothing to be seriously concerned about  If it becomes aggravated and requires surgery  you will know by the sudden increase in pain and should go to the hospital IMMEDIATELY     After a couple weeks the swelling went down and life was back to normal  Definitely take it easy  though  you don t want to make matters any worse by pushing yourself  Hockey in particular tends to cause sports hernias  so you absolutely want to stay off skates until you feel back to normal       Originally Posted by HFNHL Commish     Quote       Originally Posted by Backstrom           Just work on the muscles there and get it checked out  one of my teamates had a sports herenia  he to walk bent over for a week     It s just my opinion  but this is bad advice     Until you get a diagnosis  if it hurts to work the muscle  don t work it  If it hurts to stretch the muscle  don t stretch it     I ve been suffering from similar symptoms for over four months now  only my problem started in the groin and worked its way into the lower abdominal region  My doctor ruled out a hernia  and since then I ve seen physical therapists  a massage therapist  a chiropractor  and two orthopaedic specialists  While none of them can figure out what s wrong with me  all have agreed that it s a VERY BAD IDEA to put any undue stress on the injury   The other injuries don t help his case  He missed half of the         AAA Bantam season and some of the         AAA Midget season with shoulder injuries  I would be concerned about his ability to stay healthy ,Nolan Patrick Has Been Injured At Some Point in Each of the Last Five Seasons  He is Injury Prone ,nhl

328,LINK PROOF      November  the Las Vegas NHL hockey franchise  which will begin playing with the National Hockey League  NHL  in the         season  announced that it would be known as the Golden Knights  The decision followed recent news reports that the franchise had trademarked a series of names  including Desert Knights and Silver Knights  and many assumed that this would be the last word regarding the team s name and logo  On December  th  however  an office action issued by the U S  Patent and Trademark Office indicated that the USPTO had refused the registration of U S  Trademark Application No            which would have protected the use of the standard character mark of  VEGAS GOLDEN KNIGHTS  on entertainment services  specifically professional ice hockey exhibitions  The refusal was issued by a trademark examiner because of a concern over what is known as  likelihood of confusion   In this case the trademark examiner believed there would be a potential likelihood of confusion if the NHL hockey franchise registered GOLDEN KNIGHTS due to an already existing registered trademark held by the College of Saint Rose in Albany  NY  That school holds a trademark  which includes the phrasing GOLDEN KNIGHTS for use with intercollegiate sports exhibitions  The trademark examiner felt registering the Las Vegas NHL hockey franchise s trademark could be confusingly similar given the overlap in phrasing and the prominence of GOLDEN KNIGHTS in either mark  An official statement released by the Las Vegas Golden Knights indicates that the franchise intends to respond to the office action by next June s deadline and that such office actions refusing registration are not that unusual  which is true  Indeed  while most of the popular press has reported that the trademark has been denied by the USPTO  that is simply not true as of this point  The trademark examiner has raised concerns and is refusing registration  The applicant now has the right to respond and try and convince the trademark examiner to reconsider  Even if unsuccessful in dealing with the trademark examiner the Las Vegas NHL team would still have multiple layers of recourse through appeals if they wanted to pursue the matter further   A quick skim of the wider world of sports reflects the fact that it should not be too difficult for Las Vegas to make the case that both trademarks can coexist  In the four major professional team sports leagues operating in the U S   there are multiple examples of teams using similar nicknames  For example  the NHL s New York Rangers franchise uses the same name as Major League Baseball s  MLB  Texas Rangers franchise  The NHL s Los Angeles franchise and Sacramento s National Basketball Association  NBA  franchise are both known as the Kings  Other examples of sports team name overlaps include Panthers  NHL s Florida franchise and National Football League s  NFL  Carolina franchise   Giants  NFL s New York franchise and MLB s San Francisco franchise   and Jets  NFL s other New York franchise and NHL s Winnipeg franchise   There are no doubt other examples of two teams using the same name  Perhaps an even better example of a team name existing in multiple sports leagues at both the professional and collegiate level is the Cardinals  MLB has the St  Louis Cardinals and the NFL includes the Arizona Cardinals  Further  the NCAA has multiple colleges which use the Cardinals nickname  the University of Louisville  Ball State University and Lamar University are just a few examples of this  Stanford University is known as the Cardinal  singular  for the color not the bird  but in the world of trademark law and likelihood of confusion the presence or absence of an  s  would likely make a huge difference  or so it would seem  Of course  even without trademark registration  the Las Vegas team could still use the Golden Knights moniker in commerce  This point was underscored by a recent amicus brief filed by the American Bar Association with the U S  Supreme Court on a case involving disparaging trademarks  Although there are real benefits to having a trademark listed on the USPTO s principal register  the ABA noted that unregistrable marks still have some federal protections under the Lanham Act to prevent either consumer confusion or misrepresentation of the geographic origin of goods    Is This Is Trouble with Vegas Golden Knights ,USPTO refuses registration of Golden Knights trademark for Las Vegas NHL franchise,nhl

395,I was having this conversation with a few people at a game recently  Of course most people immediately just said Gretzky  There was one guy however who said that Mario Lemieux was most likely the best player  It s some what of a subjective question but it can be grounded in the stats    I did a little research into the career stats of some of the best players ever  The stat that really jumps out to me as the most important is not total points or most points in a season but instead it is the points per game average  The great one Gretzky is still number one in this stat with a massive       ppg  Surprisingly  Lemieux is a very close second with       ppg  Lemieux was plagued with injuries and illness during his career which limited the amount of games he was able to play  The third place is Mike Bossy with       ppg so both Lemieux and Gretzky are in another league from everyone else   We also have to ask ourselves do we really believe all points are equal  Do you think a player that has    goals and    assists is just as good as a player that has    goals and    assists  If you value goal scoring more you will see that Steve Bossy has the highest goals per game average with      followed by Lemieux in a close second with       Gretzky is only  th with       Lemieux is also first in playoff goals per game  If you take the    game season and use the numbers  Gretzky s average season is      goals and       assists while Lemieux s is      goals and      assists  Lidstrom said Lemieux was the best player he ever played against including Gretzky   Tl dr who do you think the best play ever is  Is there a case for Mario Lemiux over Gretzky ,Who is the best hockey play ever ,nhl

247,Had a long debate about this a while back  and never really came to a satisfactory answer   For a control scenario  two teams are playing at even strength  v    During play  one of the teams commits a penalty  During the ensuing delayed penalty  the non offending team scores a goal   Scoring the goal thus negates the power play that would have resulted   Easy enough  yes     Here s where the debate started   Say one of the teams is shorthanded  v    While they are shorthanded  the team on the PP commits a penalty and the team that is shorthanded scores a goal on the delayed penalty   Now    what is the result of this play   Does the scoring the goal negate the delayed penalty  thus keeping the shorthanded team shorthanded   Or because the team was shorthanded when they scored  is this a special case where the penalty would not be negated  and the player would still have to serve the penalty   Any rules experts know the answer to this one   I recall we tried to look it up  but couldn t find any satisfactory answers  which leads me to believe its the first scenario where the team would continue to be shorthanded but one goal richer  while other folks seemed to think it was the second scenario where they still get  v  play even after scoring the goal   Any info is appreciated   Edit  most upvoted comments say there is no special case in this situation   The delayed penalty is still negated as it normally otherwise would be and the teams go back to  v  with the shorthanded team up one goal  which is kind what I figured                ,Rules question  Scoring on a delayed penalty while shorthanded,nhl

9,Between the advancement in technology and the skill that has excelled over the last couple of decades  plus the changing of rules to the game  I feel like the NHL has lost a lot of it s luster as having once been the most exciting sport to watch  like it was back in the    s  The stakes don t seem as high and the obstacles don t seem as challenging for the players of today compared to the players of the    s  NHL players today make it look easy to the point of making it boring for the viewer  Rarely do you see the amazing slapshot goals that Mcinnis and Hull were known for  rarely do you see the amazing dekes Bure and Sakic were known for  rarely do you see the amazing glove saves and  robs   a term you don t hear much anymore  Roy and Hasek were known for  rarely do you see the bench brawls that would go on for a good ten minutes  Even the commentating today sucks compared to the    s    I also feel like the players themselves had more character than NHL players do now  They were eccentric and cool  They instantly elicited reverence  They knew how to promote themselves  The only player I can think of like that today is Ovechkin    I don t want to be one of those lame nostalgic  Back in my day sonny     people  but it just seems like the game is a lot more predictable these days  As a    s kid it honestly pains me to say that I have no interest in what was at one point the love of my life  ,Am I the only one who feels like the NHL has gotten increasingly boring to watch post    s era ,nhl

71,I was thinking the other day it would be awesome if the playoffs were seeded such that the top seed picked who they would play in the round  the second seed would pick from whomever is left  and so forth    Benefits   Too often a low seed team is a team that high seeded teams don t actually want to play either because they might be hot going into the playoffs  or they might not match up well  This provides more of a material benefit to being a high seed  Also  allows the high seed to consider things such as geography in making their selection    So much drama  Great underdog stories    So much to talk about for commentators and fans in the lead up to the selection    Cons   Not really sure  You can t have a fixed bracket  but the NHL had reseeding up to a few years ago anyway and so they ve dealt with this in terms of scheduling     Anyways  interested in your thoughts ,Alternate Playoff Seeding Proposal,nhl

18,    Carolina     Pts  Carolina is in full rebuild mode  the problem is the team doesn t have any superstars up front  This team needs to play badly this year so they can finally draft a forward they can build their team around  They have done a great job building up their defense but now its time to focus up front        New Jersey     Pts  The acquisition of Hall helps them up front but unfortunately moving Larsson leaves a gaping hole on the back end  The bigger issue is they replaced the loss of Larsson with Lovejoy  Last year the team finished dead is goals scored and Hall alone isn t going to take this team from lowest scoring team in the to a playoff team       Columbus     Pts  As much as I like Brandon Dubinsky as a player  I think he s a great  rd line center  Problem is  in Columbus he s their number   center  Wennberg is someone to get excited about is he ready to step up and be the teams number   center  Is he ready to line up against players like Crosby  Stamkos  Tavares and then go up against the other teams top shut down defenseman  I m doubtful but maybe  Give it a couple years and I think he can become a Nicklas Backstrom caliber player        New York Islanders     Pts  This maybe one of my more controversial picks and I get it  one there is obviously bias  Two  the Islanders are still treated like the team from the Milbury years  Okposo is gone but Ladd can certainly fill that hole  I m actually excited to see what he can do with a super star center next to him  The team has decided that its time for the young players of Lee  Nelson  Strome and Cizikas to step up  I believe they can do it and thats why I think the Islanders will take the  th and final wild card slot        Philadelphia     Pts  Ghost was the biggest of the year last year  Should have won the Calder trophy but I m not going to get into that  I do wonder if he s a   hit wonder  I certainly hope not  He is fun player to watch and I would like to see him become an elite defenseman  It took Philly awhile but they re starting to shed their older slower players  Two things are holding this team back    is goalies  Who s going to be the starter  For long stretches Neuvirth looked stronger last year but is he capable of being a number   guy  The other is they need a better  nd line center  Couturier hasn t developed the way Philly hoped  He is a great shut down guy but they need a  nd line center who can help out more with secondary scoring        New York Rangers      Pts   McDonaugh maybe the most underrated super star defenseman in the league  He is so underappreciated by the media and non Ranger fans  I expect to see Girardi and Staal to take on a lesser role this year and to see youngster Skjei to step up and become a top   d man for the team  The big thing about the Rangers is Nash  This is the most important season of his career  He needs to bounce back and get at least    goals this year  which I think he s capable   If he doesn t bounce back then its going to have to be Kreider and Miller stepping up again  The Rangers won the Vessey sweep stakes but I m not convinced  I need to see how he adapts to playing against men      Penguins      Pts  For me Matt Murray wasn t that big of a surprise  I have seen him dominate the AHL for the last   years  I was very impressed with the way he handled the pressure of being a starter in the playoffs  I m wondering how he is going to do this year but I m fairly certain that he will be just fine  I m still not crazy about this teams defense but in the playoffs they proved they were good enough        Washington Capitals      Pts  The Caps are a great team with basically no weaknesses  I like their additions of Winnik and Eller  those   should quietly help the team  They have a top goalie  great top   d pairing and the most dangerous forward group in the league  The reason why I think they re going to only have     points this year is because last year was a perfect season  at least in the regular season   Everything just seemed to go right for them and they never had a stretch of bad games  I expect them to hit a little adversity this year ,Metro Division Predictions,nhl

122,Was curious what you guys thought about it   Personally  I hate it   I think it forces teams to pick up players who are barely good enough to play in the NHL in order to keep the players actually worth their salary   It also prevents  all star  teams from forming  think the   s Wings with Yzerman  Shanahan  McCarty  Lidstrom  Osgood  etc    In addition it creates boring games when you see players who are barely NHL level playing against each other  This is just me  but I want to see the best of the best play against each other  not whoever was good enough to make a low price contract   Finally  it penalizes players  Teams have to offer players less money in order to stay under the cap and keep wiggle room ,The salary cap  love or hate ,nhl

209,I know that s their job and all  to sell the product to the viewers  but it really seemed excessive  Watching from Sportsnet  there were a ton of mentions of it being an international tournament and comparing it to the Olympics    I almost suspect it s politically motivated  The NHL really wants this tournament to be a success  they want to convince the fans that this is the true premiere tournament in the world  Because right now  the idea of not having NHL players participate in the      Olympics is just lunacy ,Anybody else think the commentators were laying it pretty thick with promoting the WCH ,nhl
210,I an an overseas fan and prefer the Canadian broadcasts and intermission shows but this post should not just be about that  Here are   options I can think of for any fan living outside of N  America  Are there any more  What other options do we have  Canadian or not        NHL TV   This looks to be the best option and is relatively inexpensive at      for the season and playoffs  My only issue with NHL TV  or NHL GCL as it used to be  is that they used to show a blank screen when the  Canadian  broadcast goes to commercials  In addition they show the same blank screen for the Canadian TV intermissions  Believe it or not  I would prefer to watch the commercials and I definitely want to listen to Hockey Night in Canada intermission show  Im not sure if the new changes with NHL TV  USA  and Rogers GCL  Canada  will change the policy with commercials and intermission show  You can access NHL TV from any IP however they do have a blackout policy which may be worth checking if NHL games are regularly broadcast where you live on other channels      Rogers Gamecenter Live  This is basically NHL TV but the NHL sold off the rights to the broadcast to Rogers  Canada   After chatting with someone from Rogers I was told that there is nothing to stop me from signing up for the service but that I would need to use a Canadian IP to access their broadcast  A proxy can solve this but there can be slow proxy servers  The  earlybird pass  is       CAD   Im assuming all the commercials and the intermission shows will be broadcast        Personal streams online  including youtube   over the years this method has become much more reliable and with HD streams too  The negatives are that ultimately it is not      guaranteed and often requires stream refresh  or the stream gets closed down which means you need to search for another one  While there are HD streams  a lot of them are not  When using this method to watch games it is advisable to scan and clean your hd afterwards for spyware and cookies etc    Are there any other options out there pay service or otherwise   Edit  spelling and context  ,Overseas fans  Discussion of what the options  pay legit or other  there are to watch live games online this season ,nhl

221,It s gotten to the point where it is just ridiculous  Goalies are so big  so fast and so good  Guys like Ben bishop and Carey price look like thier playing mini sticks out there  It s comical   The NFL is considering narrowing the field goals posts because kickers are becoming too good to the point of fundementally changing how the game is played  Why can t the NHL see that by keeping the nets the same size while goalies become bigger and faster is causing the game to change for the worse   Eventually it has to happen  People are are not getting smaller  What happens    years from now when most goalies are   feet tall      pounds and athletic   Why wait  Inreset in the NHL is diminishing  Every act the NHL makes to up goal scoring is artificial and pointless  Even if you get more goals there still going to mostly be screen  tips or rebounds  None of which are all that enthralling to watch  Make goalies have to actually make saves again instead of just having to play angles  take up the whole net and block ,Why won t the NHL consider larger nets ,nhl

251,I was just watching rat boy on the Can US pregame show and  in talking about sending NHL players to the olympics  one of his points was that fans didn t want their players going and having their season  interrupted   Does any fan feel that way  Personally  I would rather watch my favourite players win an Olympic gold than the cup   ,Why WOULDN T players go to the Olympics ,nhl

265,  I ve been watching a lot of the WCH and  while I LOVE Brett Hull and Chris Chelios as the color guys between periods  I ve gotten real sick of Linda Cohn  She never seems to have anything constructive to say  and she continually interrupts Hull and Chelios  There just seems to be no chemistry between her and those two  Also  all of her taped interviews with players have been borderline cringeworthy   especially her interview with Dustin Byfuglien and her talk with Quick Bishop Schneider  Maybe I m just a whiner but I d be happy with Adnan Virk taking over period break duties for the remainder of the tournament  Thoughts   EDIT  Virk   not Burke haha,Has anyone else disliked Linda Cohn during the WCH as much as I have ,nhl

183,I m just curious of what everyone thinks of this kid  To me he is the most dangerous and reckless player in the entire NHL  In my opinion his role in the league is to injure players and thats it  I dont want this to be a standard shit post without evidence  So here is why I think he is one of the dirtiest players in the league      Video       I know the NHL issued a statement saying why they think its a legal hit but in my opinion its charging       You don t go speed into the offensive zone like unless you re trying to hurt someone  He wasn t even concerned about the puck  his focus hitting someone at full speed  Not to mention  blind side hit    Video       He sees numbers the whole way and the idiot sitll slams MacDonald in the back    Video      Once again   hey he s not looking free chance to injure someone better than me    Video      I cant tell if he s retarded or if he has learned that he do what ever he wants without being suspended        Sticks leg out and then looks at the ref to see if he was caught  Guess what  still no suspension       Clearly goes for the head  I mean  there is one reason to throw out an elbow like that  To concuss someone       I still don t understand how this isn t and targeting the head  Just because you re taller than a player doesn t mean you can target a players head  It means you have to be more creative in making physical while trying to avoid the head    I feel like if he played for the Bruins Flyers he would have been suspended at least   times but for what ever reason the NHL seems to be pro Caps and concussions  ,Your Guys Opinion on Tom Wilson,nhl

203,Once Las Vegas has their team I m place  they will be looking to place a team in the Central Division  Houston will likely be the NHL s  st Choice   but I  understand it may be difficult to get into their building  They would be a great rival for the Dallas Stars and grow the sport in Texas  The other option is to find an owner and place a team in Kansas City  which may be the more likely option  And the NHL likes the Sprint Center  so it may not come as a surprise if the   nd winds up there  A lot of people say that KC is not a hockey market  Everyone seems to forget that the NHL expanded or placed franchises in a lot of current non traditional markets  case in point  Phoenix  Nashville   Dallas   Tampa   Miami  Anaheim  Carolina  Columbus and Atlanta  which is now Winnipeg  If the NHL is open to going to Las Vegas and these other Places   Why can t they go to Kansas City  Or relocate franchises to cities that deserve or will support them like Quebec  Seattle would also be a great relocation option if say Phoenix Arizona fails but I  understand they may try to get an arena built in Scottsdale  which they should have done in the first place  But I  see a KC Franchise happening because Detroit and Columbus are definitely not interested in returning to the West  And someone who loves the NHL   is rich and will place a franchise there will happen  Another Bill Foley type of guy for KC  And who says that the owner has to from KC to own a franchise there  There are several owners owning teams in markets that they are natives of  When you look at the North American map  not a lot of options there  and the league will have    teams  It will not stay at    ,  nd team will be Houston or Kansas City,nhl

239,    Toronto Maple Leafs     PTS    Sure they added Matthews and he surely have an impact on the team but he s only one player  He ll probably pitch in and score    goals but to me that doesn t much     They added Matt Martin to the line up  I don t really see how his additional      goals is going to make a huge impact     Nylander Looks like he is going to be a good young player but wouldn t expect more than    goals from him     The biggest question for the team this year is goaltending  How is Andersen going to handle being the starter for a bad team  I fully expect him to have the statistical year of his career   Toronto is taking the right steps but rebuilds take time and they finally have a young player to build their team around        Detroit     PTS    All good streaks come to an end and I just don t think Detroit can keep it up anymore     Nielsen will no longer be playing with Super Star Tavares and will surely see a decrease in offensive production  Zetterberg is showing his age  as is Kronwall  Not to mention they lost Datsyuk     Larkin should continue to improve this year but other than him  this team is either way too average or ageing        Boston     Pts    The addition of Backes makes it so the Bruins might have the deepest core up the middle which will make them a better team up front     The problem is  minus Marchand  There isn t much to get excited about when you look the wingers     The bigger problem is that the Bruins didn t fix their defense  They definitely have the slowest d core in the league     This is going to be another rough year in Boston       Ottawa     Pts    They will be one of the highest scoring teams in the league  unfortunately they will be among the league leaders in goals allowed as well     Looking at this team they have   guys that easily put up    goals this year which will make them a dangerous team that can and will score by committee     I don t like this teams goaltending  Anderson is showing his age and Hammond is overrated     I expect a full year with Phaneuf will help the team some but I wouldn t rely on him too much  He s not a very smart defenseman        Buffalo     PTS    The team is s close to making the playoffs  They made the right moves this offseason and you have to imagine that their youth will be improving  The problem is  there are still good teams ahead of them     I fully expect Eichel to be a    goal scorer this year and Reinhart will surely kick around        I like the addition of Kulikov and Ristolainen will continue to develop into an even stronger d man     The big question for this team is Okposo  How much of an impact will he make  I m wouldn t be surprised if we saw a dip in his offensive production  Although Eichel is a good player  he is not at the level of John Tavares yet and not having Tavares could hurt his numbers offensively     I won t be surprised if this team does make the playoffs but my prediction is they re going to be very close but sitting just on the outside        Montreal      Pts    This may be the most improved team in the league and why is that  A healthy Price  He is the difference between this team making the playoffs and missing     Radulov should help some offensively but I wouldn t expect more    goals this year  I wouldn t be surprised if he only ends up with        One thing that may hurt this team is Radulov  what kind of presence is he going to have in the locker room  He could end up being a distraction off the ice and mixed in with his lack of effort on the ice could end up hurting this team     The addition of Shaw should help too  he brings a winning attitude and nasty streak  He will certainly make the Habs more annoying to play     Lastly Shea Weber  how much of an impact the trade will have on the future of the franchise is unknown  I believe this year though  the Habs have them selves a better all around defenseman  He s slowing down some but he is still a defenseman that can control the tempo of a game        Florida Panthers      Pts    I love everything Florida has done this year  minus trading Kulikov      Bringing in Yandle makes them more dangerous on the backend  Also Matheson should be NHL ready so he ll bring even more mobility to this already very mobile defense  Signing Demers just makes their top   d core that much better and Ekblad is going to keep developing into a Norris trophy contender     Up front the team didn t make many changes but they didn t have to     The team had a very disappointing end to the season but they learned what its going to take to win a playoff series  Florida fans will probably blame the refs but if you ask the Panters players  they lost the series because they couldn t hold leads late in games and they weren t hungry enough in over time  Going     in overtime is not a recipe for success     Florida will win their first playoff series in    years this year        Tampa Bay      Pts    The team just seemed off for one reason or another last year  The team will be back on track and looking to make another push to Stanley Cup finals     This almost perfect team  They have depth at all positions  They have a super star forward who can carry them up front  they have a top defenseman in the league that controls the game and a goalie who stops the puck     I expect a bounce back year from Johnson and the entire team     This is my team to make the Stanely Cup finals out of the east       I only expect   teams to make the playoffs from the Atlantic Division   ,NHL       Atlantic Division Predictions,nhl

17,So it s been almost a whole week since my last post   I m sorry but I ve been really busy between work  summer class  and traveling that I haven t had a free night in a while   My last article was the biggest success yet which made me really happy   I also was told that I could do a better job formatting so  were going to try that for today s article on the Winnipeg Jets   This is a tough one  because they have had two franchises who were named the Jets  but were two different teams   I m going to stick with the former Atlanta Thrashers because this is my post and I get to make this decision        Past   The franchise began as the Atlanta Thrashers which was a much better name than the flames   The Thrashers were not anything special other than Kovalchuk who they traded to New Jersey for Johnny Oduya and a few prospects that are irrelevant now   They were a forgettable franchise that didn t win a single playoff game in their one appearance   They had Andrew Ladd and Dustin Byfuglien for a year before they moved to Winnipeg   The fans loved their  new  team instantly and season tickets sold out within    minutes   In Winnipeg  they built a solid team around Byfuglien and Ladd which made the playoffs in      due to the absence of two of the California teams   Unfortunately for them  the Ducks made it to the playoffs and swept the Jets candidly   Overall  they re a young franchise who has shown glimpses of hope and benefits from being in one of the strongest markets in the league              Present   In some ways they re a lot like the Calgary Flames   They both took advantage of L A  and San Jose missing the playoffs in       managed to squeak into a wildcard spot making the franchise s second appearance   They still failed to get the first postseason win in franchise history which was sad  however the younger team showed optimism   This past season they struggled and were out of the race pretty quickly   The best part of their season was undoubtedly the emergence of Mark Scheifele   After Brian Little s season ended early due to injury  Scheifele absolutely tore it up   He was almost a point per game player over the whole season  and with Wheeler and Ehlers showed he can be a bonafide  first line center   Little went down on Feb     and since then  Scheifele had    points in    games  including the one where Little got hurt    Beyond their new found beast  they have Wheeler coming off a career year  and the leagues heaviest player and biggest hitter  Dustin Byfuglien   Byfuglien is interesting because he is not just a physical  shutdown defenseman   He also brings a great shot  and the ability to quarterback a solid powerplay unit   They were let down by the step backwards taken by Jacob Trouba  and the fact that their depth players were not great   At goaltender  they have a solid young player in Connor Hellebuyck  but sent him down to avoid waiving another goalie  and possibly to help them improve their lottery odds   Hellebuyck is their best goalie for sure and he only just turned      Overall  they have a solid core  but need to see progress from their youth and depth players if they want to contend for a playoff spot in the brutal central division              Future   Their future is their bright spot   Winnipeg has several top quality prospects headlined by recently drafted Patrik Laine   In goal they have the aforementioned Hellebuyck along with Eric Comrie   They have one of the best NCAA prospects in Kyle Connor who can play center or on the wing   Connor averaged almost perfectly a goal and an assist per game and finished the season on a ridiculous point streak   On top of them  Josh Morrissey projects to be a top four defenseman and a ton of other prospects who look like they can be solid NHL players   It seems like only a matter of time before they can package a few of them for a top four defenseman and become a contender   Next year  I think Ehlers Scheifele Laine  Maybe we see Wheeler or Laine forced to LW   will be a feared line   If they stay healthy  it wouldn t be surprising to see them all as    point per game players   Overall  it is really hard to deny that they will be a great team soon   They have a championship core and now its time to build around it              Bottom Line   Winnipeg gets a       which is a little below average and clearly due to their bad history   They project to be a major threat in the central division a few years down the road   They have two of the best forward prospects in the entire NHL along with one of the next best centers   They have a few players in their prime and a good  young goalie   They have what it takes to be good  and I think they re a solid pick to be a dark horse next year in the central   I know it s frowned upon to talk about a player before he s touched the ice for an NHL game  but the addition of Laine and Connor looks to threaten Dallas for the most prolific offense   A top six of Ehlers  Scheifele  Laine  Wheeler  Little  and Connor looks like it really could   Mix in Byfuglien and their powerplay looks dangerous   Their history isn t great  but they appear to have the beginnings of greatness in the palms of their hands  ,Rating Every NHL Team     Winnipeg Jets,nhl

21,As someone who doesn t follow hockey that much  I always wondered about the following  Why don t hockey players play for their favorite teams   Let me give you an example  Sidney Crosby s favorite hockey team is the Montreal Canadiens  He  like many other Canadians  grew up cheering and rooting for them   However  he was drafted by Pittsburgh upon entering the NHL and has stayed there since  Why does he continue to play for Pittsburgh and not just voluntarily play for the Canadiens  At this point in his career  or whenever his contract is up   can t he just call up the GM of the Canadiens and say   Hey  I would like to play for you guys     Certainly he s already made his name in the annals of hockey history  and has more money than he could ever spend  Why  then  doesn t he just choose to play for his favorite childhood team a Canadian one after all  He only ended up on the Penguins because they  as a matter of circumstance  had first draft pick several seasons ago  it is not like he chose to go to the Penguins because that s the jersey he wanted to wear  right   Thanks     EDIT    Didn t Lebron James do something like this where he went back to his hometown team  even though they weren t as good as his previous team and wouldn t be able to pay him as much    ,Why don t hockey players just play for their favorite teams ,nhl
25,I may be a little biased because I am from there but I think Winnipeg is going to surprise a lot of people this year  With the scoring power they will have in their top   forwards and if they acquire a top   LD I think they will become a serious threat in the Central Division   Let me know what you think ,What team do you think will surprise the most         season,nhl

32,I know that expansion is not happening this offseason but I thought that this may be a useful fun exercise to do a mock      expansion draft scenario for this offseason   The rules are  Each team can protect   defensemen    forwards  and   goalie or   skaters and   goalie  Players who have been pros for two or fewer seasons are not eligible   With one new team for this exercise existing teams may only lose one player  Only full non movement clauses are honored in terms of automatically being protected  Teams can enter into trades with teams to have certain players selected or not selected by the expansion team   So what I need is a list of who your team would protect  Please list those players who would be available as well so we can make a comprehensive list  Also please list any trades you would offer to have certain players selected or not selected by the expansion team ,If the expansion draft was this summer   ,nhl
33,Fans of the   st century may be very surprised  before the quarterback is not always at the top of NFL salary structure  Such as the late     s  the highest league salary is two future Hall of Fame

Eagles defensive end Darren Fletcher   Cox s new contract makes him the second most expensive in the history of the NFL quarterback non players  For this reason       before the start of the season

his Language of age is a dominant game Terminator  Watts      and Lawrence has   Taylor  Reggie   White par become one desperate defensive player in history most people  This is not the first time nor

glycopyrrolate Koski  Glycopyrrolate Koski body is so terror  that many NFL experts said he was  laboratory products  or  football God s masterpiece   Barrier glycopyrrolate Koski is almost impossible  you may need to do some synthesized in the laboratory  such as Jamie   Collins size and athleticism  Richard   Sherman key ball ability and Patrick   Pete Sen s speed and flexibility  This offseason  Cardinals general manager Steve   Keyi Mu said the league is now not a complete tight end  Everett is now not only can not stop the ball pseudo offensive linemen  that does not stop the large wide

opponent  they told me Donald and JJ  Watt is the same level of players  It s incredible to me  and when I saw the video game when I realized watt and he really is a level  I mean  last season for him is brilliant  he is definitely a game Terminator       Von   Miller  linebacker  Denver Broncos   Can single handedly reverse the man of the match  Von   Miller is the biggest reason the Broncos last

external throne  then Julio   Jones infinitely close to him  Jones is clearly both in stature and more of a threat       season  his ball a few yards and receptions are the second highest in league history  Ever since entering the league in       both the strength and speed of Julio   Jones is the core of the Falcons offensive group  he is definitely more than the main team quarterback Matt   Ryan also indispensable     Odell   David Beckham  wide receiver  New York Giants   Brown and Jones should enjoy the moment the thrill of standing proudly top of the league because the league s most talented wide receiver is looming  On the output of the previous two seasons of his career  since ancient times  and nobody can Odell   compared to David Beckham  After the      season  the fifth week of the season s first show  Beckham scored    touchdowns  the same period the number of the closest alliance touchdowns Beckham is glycopyrrolate Koski  but also worse    In the end is what makes

Peterson is considered the most gifted NFL defensive backs  But before last season  many people think that stable Peterson was selected to the Pro Bowl because of his reputation as a state rather than

178,So it s safe to say that I have been a slacker recently and I apologize for that   One post in a span of about two weeks is pretty bad  but I had a bit of a surprise vacation come up   I am an American and I took the long weekend off of everything   I m back now and I plan on writing four articles in four days  with one being something other than my Rating Every NHL Team series   Today s team is the Arizona Coyotes        Past   The Arizona Coyotes began their life as the original Winnipeg Jets who dominated the WHA during its short lived life   This team featured Bobby Hull who missed the legendary Summit Series because he played in the WHA   I actually have met Bobby Hull  and I must say that he is a very kind man who let me take a picture with one of his Stanley Cup Rings  He won one as a player but was given rings for Chicago s recent cups    They then merged into the NHL where they were not able to continue their success   During their awkward transition  they posted a memorable   win season which is good for the second worst ever   Once they got their feet  they were an above average team who struggled to beat the legendary Oilers   In Winnipeg  they had Keith Tkachuk who was their most memorable player   They eventually moved to Arizona due to the crash of Canadian teams in the    s and the fact that they had a bad arena    Weird to think Winnipeg fans didn t kill people over this    In Arizona  their history has been marked by their failures to develop as a hockey market  their impending move as a team  and the career of Shane Doan   They had a good run in the      playoffs  but nothing else too noteworthy   They also are known for having legendary  for the wrong reasons  goaltender Ilya Bryzgalov  Overall  their history has a few good players  but isn t anything too special                  Present   The Arizona Coyotes had a terrible         season where their GM literally admitted to tanking   They were unlucky  however and won a crucial game in Buffalo  which contributed to their finishing in second to last   Arizona then got bumped out of the top two in the draft by Edmonton  and missed out on either Eichel or McDavid   They went into the         season as favorites to land hometown kid  and hopeful franchise saver  Auston Matthews  but surprised everyone by starting out the season very well   They defied expectations with the help of the Domi Hanzal Duclair line which eventually was not able to carry the load and eventually  the surging Ducks passed Arizona in the standings and resulted in Arizona missing the playoffs   On top of those three  they have a team legend in Shane Doan who should be in the tail end of his career  and also have one of the best offensive devensemen in the league in Oliver Ekman Larsson   They did not get a chance to draft Matthews  but did however get both Clayton Keller and Jakob Chychrun   This was thanks to savvy new general manager  John Chayka   Chayka has been GM for a short period of time  but has shown to be more than capable with his ability to lure in Alex Goligoski after trading for his negotiating rights  and his confidence at the draft table   He s young for a GM  but he is acting like he is large and in charge   Chayka comes form a non traditional background in advanced analytics  and could be the next  Moneyball  story bringing success to a low budget team   I am really intrigued in what he has to offer  and I can t wait to see what his next move is   Overall  they ve had a rather quick turnaround from their recent down period  but still don t look to be too much of a factor in the Pacific  so long as the California teams remain dominant                  Future   The Coyotes have a young team  and a great cap situation  which factors to be the beginning of a successful franchise   I think that they have a good core in place  but lack the true     Selke type center that it takes to win in today s NHL   I think that they will struggle to overtake the California teams  and will be one of many competing for a wildcard spot   I think that they definitely can build a good team around Ekman Larsson and Domi  but they will need a better center to build a great team around them   Hopefully for their sake  either Dylan Strome or Clayton Keller can become that big center required to win in the west   They also have Nick Merkley who was selected with the   th overall pick in the loaded      draft   I think Merkley is going to surprise people because of his sheer speed   I have seen him play a few time and I was very impressed   I was shocked to see him drop to      For some reason  I feel like he will develop into a solid second line winger for the Coyotes   I could even see him playing with Domi and doing very well   Also in their prospect pool is Louis Domingue who showed flashes of brilliance in the NHL this year during Mike Smith s absence   Overall  I think that the Coyotes have a shot at a wildcard spot  but I think they are a few years away from being a serious contender              Bottom Line   The Coyotes get a       which was a lot better than I thought they would do   Despite this  I stand by my evaluation that they are not actually that bad in the present   They were especially bad last year in an admitted attempt to finish last place  which is forgiven by their growth this past season   I think that their future as a team looks good  however it is in question whether or not it will be in the state of Arizona   I chose not to include this in the future section of the article  because I think that it has little to do with the ability of their players    I think the Coyotes are in a good position to move forward  and that they need to be careful if they want the Ekman Larsson era to be fruitful

Martin Hanzal  and Antoine Vermette by playing them in the top six  and then trade him for valuable draft picks at the deadline   Either a first  if they go together  or two seconds  if they go in separate deals     Meek  Louis Domingue takes over and flourishes as the starting goalie after Mike Smith has a rough start to the year         Boston Bruins   Bold  David Pastrnak gets traded for a gritty power forward between now and July          Meek  Tuukka Rask has an off year  Chara is noticeably too slow  and the Bruins miss the playoffs        Buffalo Sabres   Bold  Jack Eichel does not break    points  and Sabres fans incorrectly begin to panic that he is not going to become the star that he was expected to be  Meek  Led by a breakout year from Rasmus Ristolainen  the Sabres fight for a playoff spot  but just barely miss out          Calgary Flames   Bold  The Flames finish with     points but still miss the playoffs  Meek  Brian Elliot fits in well  Gaudreau and Monahan have great seasons again  and their defense looks a lot more like what it was in                Carolina Hurricanes   Bold  They show that           was a fluke  and they descend toward the bottom of the standings   Meek   Cam Ward and Eddie Lack end the season with just about the same number of starts  and neither one is all that impressive        Chicago Blackhawks   Bold  Ryan Hartman shows that he has the tools to become the next Matt Martin  and is part of a popular fourth line  Meek  Brian Campbell fits like a glove at first  but slows down as the year goes on   He doesn t look too good in the playoffs as father time begins catching up to him        Colorado Avalanche   Bold  This is the final year for both Joe Sakic and Patrick Roy  Meek  Jarome Iginla retires after the entire team has a bad year and misses the playoffs again        Columbus Blue Jackets   Bold  David Clarkson plays     games and begins to look more like the Clarkson in New Jersey  Meek   Ryan Murray becomes the next Adam Larsson  and Columbus trades him for a forward of more value        Dallas Stars   Bold  Benn and Seguin can t score enough to make up for the goals let up by their goaltending  but Dallas still makes the playoffs as the  rd  th best team in the West  Meek   John Klingberg has another stellar season and proves that he is one of the best defensemen in the league for his contract        Detroit Red Wings   Bold  The Wings end their streak and finally miss the playoffs  Meek  Thomas Vanek plays fewer than    games for reasons other than injury        Edmonton Oilers   Bold  Despite

334,What would have happened if Steven Stamkos were to leave Tampa Bay   As we all know by now  Steven Stamkos was the speculation of many trade rumors during his final year of his contract  and Stamkos Watch was always one of the top talking points during this past season  Stamkos made Tampa fans rejoice and other potential suitors weep as he resigned with the Bolts for  yr     million  which is incredibly cheap for a player of his caliber  But what were to happen to the Lightning if Stamkos were to chase the money instead of the stability  Let s see   There were three potential suitors for Stamkos before he signed  the San Jose Sharks  the Toronto Maple Leafs  and the aforementioned Tampa Bay Lightning  If he would have signed with another team  no matter whether the Maple Leafs or the Sharks took Stamkos  Tampa s lineup would have looked like this   Forwards Palat  Kucherov  and Johnson Drouin  Filppula  and Namestnikov  Callahan  Boyle  and Brown Paquette  Killorn  and Conacher  Defensemen  Hedman Stralman  Coburn Garrison Koekkoek Sustr   Goalies  Ben Bishop  Andrei Vasilevskiy  and Kristers Gudlevskis  Nikita Kucherov and Victor Hedman become the faces of the franchise  though both of their contracts are strange as well  It s a safe assumption to say that Tampa would have made the playoffs  with Kucherov as a Top    NHL player  but would get eliminated in the first or second round by a better team such as the New York Islanders or Pittsburgh Penguins  After that season  they most likely lose Ben Bishop  Victor Hedman  and Jonathan Drouin  effectively ending their playoff hopes for the next few years    It s a downward spiral effect that a player of Stamkos  caliber has on the rest on the team  Without Stamkos  the Lightning s goal production would have most certainly gone down by a substantial margin  The same is true for the opposite  Since Stamkos stayed and actually gave the Lightning a hometown discount  the trickle down effect also reached the other critical pillar of the franchise  Victor Hedman    yr     million  and should happen to RFA Nikita Kucherov as well   Leave your opinions on the matter and please follow me  Tampa baysports on Instagram or  baysports tampa on Twitter for the latest news and scores of the Lightning  Bucs  and Rays  If you have any questions or suggestions about my next article  please feel free to email me at Tampabaysports  gmail com,What would have happened if Steven Stamkos were to leave Tampa Bay ,nhl

20,The NHL has announced the three finalists for the MVP trophy   Sidney Crosby  a two time winner  finished third in the league with    points in    games  including a league high    points in    games in        After a slow start to the season  the coaching change to Mike Sullivan sparked the team and rejuvenated the Penguins  star   If he wins  he ll be just the  th player to win the award three times  joining the likes of Wayne Gretzky  Mario Lemieux and Alexander Ovechkin   The only two players to score more points than Crosby were the two players he is in competition with for the award  Fellow Canadian star  Jamie Benn  finished the season second in the league with    points in    games and scored the third highest goal total with     It was the first    goal season by a Star since Mike Modano in             NHL Hart Trophy FinalistsHe captained the Dallas Stars to their first division title since the           season  His Hart trophy finalist nomination is the first in the franchise s history   The third candidate    and most likely to win    is Patrick Kane  Who would ve expected the season he had considering the offseason he had just prior  After a sexual assault allegation over the summer  many  experts  in the media debated whether or not the Blackhawks should release their star and     million man  The specifics of the situation may not be clear  but the bottom line is that the charges were dropped and he was exonerated   The Hawks did not decide to move their star and they were rewarded handsomely for it  He got off to the hottest NHL Hart Trophy Finalistsstart in recent memory and went on a franchise record    game point streak  It was also the longest such streak in    years  He created such a cushion in the scoring race and was able to maintain pace throughout the rest of the year that the winner of the Art Ross Trophy  awarded to the league s top point scorer  was never really in doubt   Kane finished with     points to become the first United States born player to ever win the award  That s pretty incredible considering the numbers that were put up by players like Modano  Brett Hull  and Jeremy Roenick  He also finished second in the league with    goals  This is unknown territory for American born players and further proof that the United States is catching up in terms of player development   After a few solid showings at the Olympics  the U S  will have a chance to battle for some hardware at the upcoming World Cup of Hockey   Resource   ,Interesting read   Who Are This Year s NHL Hart Trophy Finalists ,nhl

49,During the Western Conference Final  which featured the resilient San Jose Sharks eliminating the  playoff chokers  St  Louis Blues in six games  Blues star right winger  Vladimir Tarasenko  was nowhere to be seen until the final period of the last game    Tarasenko      has been with the Blues ever since they drafted him   th overall in the      NHL Entry Draft  He joined the team in the         lockout shortened season  and has shown his prescence on the ice ever since  Many see him as the best player on the Blues  which is a large reason as to why the Blues organization awarded him with an eight year      million deal  which carries an AAV of      million a year    No matter what team you root for  even a Chicago fan like myself   you have to see that  Vova  is a rare  exceptional talent  One that doesn t come around every year  His extreme puck skills  vast sniping attributes and overall insane hockey IQ make him one of the most valuable players in the league  He was the second best  Cost per Point  player in the NHL this year  behind Blackhawks right wing Patrick Kane    Even at a high cap hit of      million per year  roughly      percent of St  Louis  salary cap  it is apparent that the Blues got him on a cheaper amount than his skills would command for  But is Tarasenko  coming off his best year with the Blues  beginning to want to leave St  Louis   At the Blues locker room clean up day  many Blues players like Alex Pietrangelo  Kevin Shattenkirk and David Backes all reflected on the Blues best season in years  praising the teams dedication  perseverance and dominance on the ice  But Tarasenko declined to comment with reporters  not even offering any insight on how he felt about the season or his plans for his shortest offseason of his career   Now  this isn t supposed to be a  bash Tarasenko for not talking to the media  type piece  Not at all  Personally  I love it when athletes don t talk to barely talk to reporters  because if I had just lost a game I wouldn t be too happy either  But still it s worth questioning and discussing the possibility of Vova being unhappy with the Blues   The Blues were able to eliminate the defending Stanley Cup champions  the Chicago Blackhawks  in the first round  even though it took a grueling seven games  However  numerous times it seemed like Blues head coach Ken Hitchcock was not playing Tarasenko enough  or just not at the right times  Chicago s penalty kill wasn t as strong as years past  even with penalty killing forward Marcus Kruger back  But at some points Tarasenko was not on the ice and expressed his frustration numerous times with his head coach  most notably at the end of the second period in game   against Chicago when Tarasenko was visibly unhappy with Hitchcock   Could his difficult time in the Western Conference Final  his seemingly worsened relationship with Hitchcock and his refusal to talk to reporters at locker room clean up day be a sign that Vova wants to leave St  Louis  Does he want general manager Doug Armstrong and co to shake up the roster to stray away from the Anaheim Duck like check first style of play to the Pittsburgh Penguin like speed first style of play  Does he want to become captain of the team to further shape what gets shown on and off the ice from the Blues   Many questions could be asked about what Vladimir Tarasenko wants from the Blues and what his media refusal means for the incredible player  Only time will tell what happens to the scene in St  Louis    Feel free to comment  question and discuss this  If you think this article was just an over exaggeration of a simple act  why  If you think Vladimir Tarasenko wants out of St  Louis  like the Rams did   where do you think is a reasonable landing spot for Vova ,Is the Tarasenkshow unhappy with the scene in St  Louis ,nhl
56,At the beginning of the Stanley Cup playoffs  many people counted out the defending Eastern Conference Champions Tampa Bay Lightning  Without captain Steven Stamkos due to blood clots seemed to be too much for the team to handle   But with streaky young winger Jonathan Drouin added a pleasant consistency to the team  making the Lightning almost as good as they are with Stamkos    Unfortunately  they lost to the Pittsburgh Penguins in seven games in the Eastern Conference Final  Still  their         season is nothing short of an exceptional one  They were able to play    games without Stamkos in the playoffs  winning    of them  They lost starting goalie Ben Bishop in game   of the ECF  being forced to play Andrei Vasilevskiy  They made it all the way to the end of of the Eastern Conference Final  It was a great season   But a rough offseason awaits the Lightning  They have to resign Steven Stamkos  Nikita Kucherov  Alex Killorn  J T  Brown and other skaters  They don t have much cap space to do so  So who stays  who signs with another team and who is traded   I don t feel as if Stamkos is as big of a necessity to the Lightning as years past  They re stronger  smarter and overall a good team with and without their captain  There s two routes the Lightning could take  sign him or let him go   Sign him  it will obviously take a lot of money to re sign Stamkos  He has been a great player  leader and person for the Lightning organization ever since he was drafted  Patrick Kane and Jonathan Toews both got       million a year  Sidney Crosby makes      million a year  Ryan Getzlaf makes       million  Stamkos could argue for     million a year  If Stamkos signs a   year      million dollar contract  it could benefit and hurt the team  The benefits are keeping an experienced player  who has already played in a Stanley Cup final  around for seven more years  keeping a great sniper who has the ability to score every shift and a guy who is great with the Tampa Bay community  But it will come with a cost  An     million cap hit would be roughly     of the Lightning s salary cap each year  That s an awfully large number  and consistently contending would be difficult   Let him go  this opens up loads of money for the Lightning to re sign guys like Kucherov  Brown  Killorn and Namestnikov  They have shown that Stamkos isn t a necessity to the team like he used to be  he s just a huge piece to a great team  The benefits of letting him go are more opportunities to sign other players  allow guys like Palat  Drouin and Tyler Johnson to sign to big deals  and bring back Victor Hedman after next season  They would be losing an incredible player though  and the risk of not having a central leader come through would be an issue   Personally  I think the Lightning should at least try and negotiate a deal with Stamkos  I believe a fair deal for him is   years at      million per year  General Manager Steve Yzerman could use things like his somewhat slow starts to seasons and his disappearance in the      Stanley Cup Final against the Chicago Blackhawks to talk down his salary  If not possible to re sign  letting him go is a great route as well  but it would be tricky to establish a core group of players that will contend each year for the Stanley Cup   What do you guys think  Should the Lightning re sign Steven Stamkos  or should they let him go and bank on the current players becoming stronger and erasing the loss of their captain  Let me know what you think ,What should the Lightning do with Steven Stamkos ,nhl
61,Many people including myself believe that selecting finnish winger Patrik Laine would be the best option  However  it wouldn t necessarily be the safest   The Jets are a very young team with great depth in their prospect young guns pool  with examples in Nikolaj Ehlers  Joel Armia  Josh Morrisey  Connor Hellebuyck  NCAA award winner Kyle Connor among many others  Knowing this  should the Jets Vet up   The oldest players on the Jets roster thought             years  were Chris Thorburn and Mark Stuart who are Bottom   F and Top   D respectively  Stuart has done a great job at mentoring Jacob Trouba and will likely do the same for Morissey in the near future  Thorburn  who is a grinder  has been balancing time between lineup and healthy scratch  He has helped in giving the team the aggressive style the team is known for and what is necessary in the Central Division  He is a team leader in every sense of the word and has helped giving an aggressive edge in the game in players such as C Adam Lowry   Despite this  the Jets don t have bona fide stars who can also captain and mentor young players  i e  Jonathan Toews   There has been real talk about GM Kevin Cheveldayoff trading away that pick undoubtedly with more  to the Washington Capitals for    year old Alexander Ovechkin  The Jets would need a player like this on their first line with Wheeler and Scheifele  although an Ovechkin trade is mega unlikely    This likely isn t in the best interest for management however  and I do not believe it is in my own  I would love to hear ideas from you guys to try and find out what would be a suitable fit for the Jets if they do decide to vet up in the hopes to develop players quicker    ZZbottom          ,What should the Jets do with their second overall pick ,nhl

91,The Pittsburgh Penguins defeated the San Jose Sharks     in game   of the      Stanley Cup Final Monday Night  Once again  it was a thrilling first game for the final round of the playoffs  much like Chicago vs Tampa in       Los Angeles vs New York Rangers in      and Chicago vs Boston in       Now  the first game is not always an exact teller of how the series will be played  Last years first game showed that Chicago and Tampa would not let the other team get any wiggle room at all  But Los Angeles vs New York in      was really the Kings dominating things the whole time  the Rangers were too weak to contend   Back to last night s game  The first period was intense for both teams  with the Penguins playing their speed first game and captain Sidney Crosby showing why he is the best player in the world  setting up Conor Sheary s goal to give them a     lead  Bryan Rust scored the first goal  It easily could ve been     at the end of the first for the Penguins had Martin Jones not have been in net for the Sharks  He stood on his head  and stopped    of    Penguins shots in the first   The second flipped the script for the most part  The Sharks were showing they worked on their game in the intermission  with more speed and pucks getting to Matt Murray  This allowed both Tomas Hertl and Patrick Marleau to score  tying the game at     heading into the third  In the latter part of the second period  the Penguins got back to their first period play  but the Sharks were mostly the better team    The third was intense and fun to watch  Both teams were playing a high speed     foot game  with fast breakouts and great puck possession for both teams  Nick Bonino scored on a good pass from Kris Letang with      left  and that proved to be the dagger  Despite Ben Lovejoy taking and unwarranted penalty at       in the third  giving the Sharks a power play  they were not able to sustain any pressure  and the Penguins held on for victory      final ,Stanley Cup Final game   recap,nhl

169,So  I am new to the NHL and trying to figure out a team  I live in Iowa so it d make sense to follow the Wild  Blackhawks  or maybe Blues  they are a bit farther away and out of the way  so a lesser option versus the other two for me right now   I ve been playing NHL    and have been digging the Blackhawks and feel something there  but would feel kind of weird following a team that has had so much success lately as all the other teams I follow in the majors sports I ve watched struggle for years before I ve seen success    So basically  I m wondering if following the Blackhawks at this point would be bad  Would it be better to just go ahead and follow the Wild  I just see myself moving to Chicago when I finish school  or at least I d like to   and consdering I already feel something with this team I think it d be a good fit ,New to the NHL,nhl

178,I was at the game  I live in San Jose and a buddy came up with tickets  and I noticed that on three separate occasions Lovejoy skated over to the end where the Sharks shot on in periods   and      He seemed to give something or get something from one of the people working at the stadium but I couldn t see what was happening  I was at the very back of the stadium haha    Anyway it is never something I have seen anyone else do this and would love answers   Edit  I forgot to mention once he left the bench to skate over  like he was sitting on the bench  the play stopped and he went over opened the door  gate   at the corner and conversed with the people working there ,Why does  did   Ben Lovejoy skate over to the corner and open the boards   times last night ,nhl
181,Maybe that s insane conspiracy theory  but I wonder if anybody has suspicion that NHL tries to affect playoff games results  Not by setting everything up  But using some subtle methods  Referees became more tolerant when one teams do something questionable etc  Everything in order to make series more engaging  and possibly longer  Sometimes it s impossible  but still they can maximize chances to obtain desired state of affairs ,NHL and match fixing,nhl
186,So  i love the raiders in the NFL  i recently got into hockey and i have struggled with the problem of choosing my favorite team  When I was about    i went to Vancouver with my parents to meet a friend from them  he was a die hard Canucks fan and introduced e into the game and gave me a Canucks hockey stick and shirt of Daniel Sedin  currently i m    years old  go into hockey about   months ago  i fell like i should support the Canucks  however  they are not very physical which i enjoy in hockey but i enjoy watching the Sedins play  I came along the LA kings as well  they are a physical team and their uniform is similar to the raiders and they play in the same state  I also came to the Boston Bruins  i like their uniform and logo and tuuka rask is a beast  however zdeno chara is    years old  I am a troubled Mexican who would like some help on choosing an NHL team that i will follow for the rest of my life  i dont really care about team success  just the assurance that i will stick with them for many following years  THANKS ,Which should be my favorite team ,nhl

220,RECAP  The Penguins can officially win their   Stanley Cup in franchise history with a win Thursday night  They ve never had the opportunity to win it in Pittsburgh  so I m sure they ll do everything they can to claim victory  The Sharks  however  need to pull everything together and win three straight to win their first Stanley Cup  It will be nearly impossible for them to pull it off  as coming back from a     deficit is incredibly hard to do  Anyways let s get into the recap   First period  the beginning of the period was probably the best the Sharks played the whole game  They were pinching along the boards hard  and made it very hard for the Penguins to exit the zone  But a rebound goal by Ian Cole seemed to tilt the ice in the Penguins favor  The Sharks had a good powerplay opportunity  but to no avail  Crosby had a good period as well   Second period  this is where it became apparent the Penguins had  gotten  to the Sharks  An early powerplay goal by Evgeni Malkin rattled the home team  as two posts by the Penguins seemed to rattle Martin Jones  as he began to look uncomfortable in net  The Sharks also had just one shot on goal    minutes into the period  and a good powerplay for them sustained some pressure but still no goal    Third period  the Penguins began to  play not to lose  and the Sharks began to sustain way more pressure  Melker Karlsson scored a goal to cut the Penguins lead in half  and it seemed as if the game could go to overtime  But a nifty pass from Carl Hagelin to Eric Fehr put the dagger in the coffin  and the Penguins held on to win       Side note  if the Penguins do win on Thursday  and win the series      I don t think I ve ever seen a Stanley Cup that wasn t apparent that the victor was the better team  When Los Angeles beat New York two years ago  it was apparent that LA was the better  more dominant and more balanced team  But this year both teams could end up winning the Cup  Any way it pans out  it is one of the best Stanley Cups I ve ever seen ,Stanley Cup Final game   recap,nhl

240,Thanks for clicking on this link  I have decided to start writing a series where I take every NHL team and give them a rating based on their past  present  and future   I will upload posts as soon as I am done writing them  and therefore I do not already have a list of how I rate each team   I am going to try and post about three per week  but that may change   I am a full time college student from September May and I am taking a few Summer classes which will dictate when I post   I also play for my college club team   My goal is to have people read this and to enjoy writing each review   Who knows  maybe this will become something big someday   I m going to go in the inverse order of the standing for this season  which means that the Toronto Maple Leafs are on deck for today   As always  comments and critiques are greatly appreciated      PAST   Toronto is the league s biggest market and also happens to be an original six team   They have    cups  but none since     which is pretty bad   They have their fair share of legends from Wendel Clark to Ace Bailey which helps their cause but still can t fix their lack of success in recent years   Though they did not win the cup  they have had some good years somewhat recently  with the      season standing out   Overall  I give it a       but ask me again in a few years and it may change    Present   When the highlight of your season is trading away bad contracts and draft lottery success  it s hard to argue that your team is remotely good right now  however with many prospects on the verge of being NHL ready  the Maple Leafs are poised to be good sometime soon  The commitment to the rebuild is surprising considering how committed Lou Lamoriello was to icing the best team possible in New Jersey   This along with the fact that Garret Sparks can have a blue and white checkerboard on his pads makes me think that Shanahan is making the final decisions   It is slightly cheating to include the future of the team in the present category  but the sense of optimism and the thought of reaching the light at the end of the tunnel can be felt by Leafs fans right now   Overall I give it a       with the only positive coming from the future assets already owned by the team    Future   With prospects like Marner  Matthews  I am going to assume they take him   Nylander  a young team  a great coach front office  and a recent purge of bad contracts  the future of the Leafs looks great   The biggest concern right now is that the Toronto market will eat these young players alive   Toronto actually has plenty of similarities with the Blackhawks of the present   Both teams were original six franchises without a cup since the    s   Both teams had an elite  goal scoring prospect on the wing  Marner and Kane  along with an elite  well rounded center prospect  Toews and Matthews    We still don t know if Morgan Rielly and Jake Gardiner can become anything like Keith and Seabrook for Chicago  however the signs are promising that they can become solid players at least   With all the young and talented prospects in the deep pool that the Leafs have  it wouldn t be surprising to see at least one of them turn into a pretty good NHL player   Overall  their future appears to be great among their forwards  with questions about their depth defense   I expect one more year without the playoffs  another top    pick  and then a good team for the         season   Beyond that  they look to be a contender for years to come          Bottom Line    The Leafs get a        which has no meaning to me yet because I have yet to rate another team   My guess is that this is going to be around the average  but as I touched on earlier  give the Leafs another      years and they ll make people start to forget their previous failures   Leafs fans are soon going to be happy for the first time in a while  ,Rating Every NHL Team     Toronto Maple Leafs,nhl

261,I ve become pretty interested in hockey since I started watching the playoffs this year  I know almost nothing  so a few quick questions      What is the purpose of one player standing in front of the goalie  Is he trying to block the view of the goalie  Is he trying to get a deflection  That seems like a really low chance      Why don t they allow fighting in the post season      Why do some players take shots from like    feet away from the goal  seems like a very low probability     What would be considered a  blowout  if you are up     going ino the  rd period is it pretty much over      How long are players usually on the ice for  Do the lines usually keep the same personnel throughout the game or throughout the season  with the same players always playing with each other      Who are some of the up and coming players I should look out for  and what team are they on      Any hockey stats that I should be aware of  that might help me understand the game a little better  or at least who is having an impact      I m thinking about adopting a team to root for  I ve always kind of liked the St  Louis Blues because my dad got me a Blues shirt when I was about     But I m open to hear pitches for your team   Thanks for the help  It s a fun sport and really intense in the playoffs  Helps when I m not watching the NBA or baseball gets boring ,Some questions for someone new to the sport,nhl

293,I want to say thanks for all the support on my last two articles   I really enjoy writing these  and I am glad to see that there are people who enjoy reading my work   Today s team will be the Vancouver Canucks   I went to many NHL games this year  and my favorite was definitely Vancouver   New Jersey   These all happened at the game              And this happened after the game      To make things even better  they had another game in exactly two weeks   With Prust actually playing in this game  there were sure to be fireworks  right   You could definitely count on Prust v  Farnham  Any Canuck v  Larsson  and Tootoo v  Burrows   Well  in short  none of these happened   Prust finished the game without registering a single hit in   minutes of ice time   Prust was all talk   Bobby Farnham  Adam Larsson  and Alex Burrows all finished the game without a scratch   There were many penalties  but the only malicious one occurred when John Moore cleared Burrows out with a crosscheck to the face in the final minute or so of the game   This gives St  Louis v  Dallas game   a run for its money for biggest letdown of the year  and I had to share this with you because I don t think it got the attention it deserved      Past  The Canucks history is nothing too special   They ve had their fair share of legends with Bure  Naslund and the Sedins  Sadly  a large part of their history has been their riots   Most fans know about the recent riot after losing to Boston on home ice in game     This riot caused over    million in damages at the time and also disgraced the Canucks organization   Many fans forget  or are too young to remember the riots in        Again  the Canucks lost in game   of the Stanley Cup Final  this time to the Rangers   This riot was not nearly as bad  but still resulted in over    million in damages and a rioter being put in a coma for   weeks and given permanent brain damage   I almost feel bad for the Canucks that this is such a major part of their history   Beyond this  they had a pretty good team in the      s during the Sedin Era   They won two President s Trophies  which exemplified the idea that they were much better in the regular season than in the playoffs   They were always a good bet to make the playoffs  but not really a good bet to go on a far run   Unfortunately for the Canucks  the Sedins are old now and they somehow went from having two good goaltenders and an ok starter great backup  to having Ryan Miller several years past his prime   On top of this  the rest of their team has either left or dropped off  which has led to the Canucks becoming of the league s bottom feeders   I also can t complete the  past  section without dropping Mark Messier s name somewhere  so here it is   Mark Messier   There  I included it twice   Sorry  Canucks fans   Their history isn t that great  but could surely be worse  Overall  they have had good stretches  but nothing too memorable that didn t involve tear gas         Present  Their present isn t that good either   They just traded one of their better prospects for Erik Gudbranson who will be fun to watch   They also traded Nick Bonino to the Penguins who is currently lighting it up on a line with Kessel and Hagelin   One can only imagine how differently their season would have gone if they kept Bonino  and traded for Hagelin and Kessel who were both moved for relatively low prices   One year removed from a playoff appearance  the Canucks posted the league s second worst offense and also had a bottom    defense   The Canucks also managed to create their own goalie problem by trading away Luongo  Schneider  and Lack   The Lack trade was especially questionable because he was the most recent and also returned a later pick   This past season  I was expecting a breakout year for Bo Horvat who improved but not by as much as I expected   The Canucks also managed to remain in the playoff race for a bit due to Anaheim s slow start and the fact that the Canucks had a lot of overtime losses in the beginning   The fact that they took a big step back from last year isn t surprising   Few expected the Sharks and Kings to miss the playoffs again  and even fewer expected the Canucks to maintain their spot   They are an older team who is going to have to commit to a full on rebuild in order to succeed again   The reality is  tanking   or  rebuilding  works well   They were poised to have a top   pick this year  but were bumped down by Winnipeg and Columbus during the draft lottery   Overall  this is a team who s begun taking steps backwards as their core ages  and their management struggles with trades           Future  They might be able to have a better year next season  but don t show any signs of being in the playoff race   Like Edmonton  they simply need too many teams to get significantly worse   Their only real chance is if the Sedins can find the fountain of youth and put up an     point season   They would also need a hell of a season from Ryan Miller if they even want to trouble the California teams   Realistically  this won t happen  the Sedins will retire in a few years and the team will struggle to and through that point  They have a few good prospects including University of North Dakota forward Brock Boeser   They also have a top tier goalie prospect in Thatcher Demko who was one of the best goalies in the NCAA last year   Jake Virtanen has the tools to make a scary partner to UFA target and hometown hero  Milan Lucic   Two big power forwards like those would be exciting to watch and also terrifying to play against   They also have the  th pick in this year s draft  and probably a top    pick in the next three   There isn t much else to say about their future unless they found the next Pavel Datsyuk in the past few drafts   Being a Canucks fan doesn t seem easy           Bottom Line  The Canucks earned a       which is pretty bad   They ll rank higher than some teams  but there won t be many beneath them   It must be hard being a Canucks fan   I think the riots really speak volumes about the Canucks   These fans are so passionate about hockey and the team they love  that they re willing to pay some of the highest ticket prices in the league to watch their team lose   They deserve something to cheer about  but just when it looks like they have it  the Canucks find a way to lose it in the most painful way possible  and then the fans take their anger out on the city   The riots are a result of the built up frustration by the fans after years without success   They could make an incredible underdog run to game   of the cup final next year  and rather than appreciate the unexpected success  the fans would burn down the city   This is a city that truly deserves a cup  but doesn t appear to be anywhere near close   ,Rating Every NHL Team     Vancouver Canucks,nhl

405,So my last post had a higher upvote percentage  but fewer upvotes than my Edmonton one   I am definitely happy with the love this series has been shown   I also apologize that its been a few days since the last one   I ve been busy   Today s team is the Columbus Blue Jackets who finished fourth worst in the league    Past  They began playing in the         season and to put it honestly  they have had no success since then   They ve only made the playoffs twice in their history  and have only won two playoff games   They are a new franchise which makes this slightly more forgivable  however this by no means is success   They have been subpar at drafting  with their most noted failure being the fourth pick of the legendary      draft being wasted on Nikolay Zherdev   They did  however succeed when they drafted Rick Nash at number   the year before   For a very long time  Nash was the heart and soul of the team who seemingly scored or assisted on all of their goals   This changed when he was shipped off to the Rangers in exchange for a return of several  solid players   Even this  was not able to help the team at all as they still struggled to get just one playoff win   They finally got their win against the Pittsburgh Penguins in       but eventually lost in six   They re a franchise who essentially lacks any real history   Unfortunately  they have been perennial losers   Overall  they really have no history worth remembering    years from now          Present  Unfortunately for Blue Jackets fans  this section isn t too good either   Two years ago they made the playoffs and finally won games   The past two years serve as evidence to the thought that the playoff year was a peak and not the start of something special   Perhaps the most exciting event to happen to the Blue Jackets was the Ryan Johansen   Seth Jones trade   This trade was part of the dying breed of player for player trades and allowed Jarmo Kekalainen to finally get his coveted elite defenseman   I honestly think that Johansen was an adderall prescription away from becoming one of the top players in the league  but for whatever reason he sometimes appears to lack focus   I thought that a coach like Tortorella would be able to bring out the best in him  yet he still struggled to reach his true potential   I think Seth Jones is a very good return for Johansen  but I do think that in order for him to reach his full potential  Columbus needs to become a competitive team soon   I feel like Columbus is in a bit of a limbo situation   They ve been rebuilding for years and still cannot find success   It almost seems as if they need a major shake up  but things didn t change when Tortorella arrived   Their current roster is built to be a bigger team who really grinds down the other team on the forecheck   Players like Foligno  Hartnell  Clarkson  and Jenner are all big men who can play this way  but I think they need to add a few other forwards before they can truly play like Los Angeles does   At least they have a goalie who has had a few good seasons in Bobrovsky   Overall  their team is currently missing a lot of pieces and has not been good          Future  Columbus has a good prospect pool with players like Bjorkstrand  Korpisalo  and Werenski   One player who I think fits perfectly into the Columbus system is Paul Bittner   He was hurt this year which isn t a great sign  but he is      and     lbs   This is a guy who could probably put on ten or twenty pounds and become a serious power forward   I think Columbus would be a good fit for Okposo and Backes  however I doubt they would be willing to sign for a non contender   A first line of Foligno Backes Okposo would give defensemen nightmares among other things   I would not expect Columbus to make much of a splash in free agency  because their cap situation is actually quite tight with Seth Jones due to get a huge raise from his rookie contract   There have been rumors of Columbus moving down in the draft which were further fueled by the team recently when they invited some prospects to interviews who were not on anyone s radar at      I could definitely see Kekalainen taking Logan Brown a few picks down and getting maybe a second or prospect in return   I also think they have a solid chance at surprising a lot of people and staying in the hunt for a playoff spot for most of the next season   I think that with a few new prospects likely coming up  and with hopefully a healthy David Clarkson  that they have a good chance at seeing a big step forward   The whole Clarkson clause it a huge  if   and I think it s more likely than not that he spends a lot of time on the IR  or on the healthy scratch list   It s a shame because I really like what he did for New Jersey in      both in the regular season  and in the playoffs playing with a broken foot   I also am sad to see him struggling because I kind of knew him   Hopefully he can beat the injury bug and have a full season in Columbus   Overall  they have some good prospects and a top pick  but their cap situation is surprisingly bad for a bottom   team  and they also seem to need a major change          Bottom Line  Columbus scores a      which is almost definitely going to put them in the bottom   of our rankings   It s not their fault that they are a new team and that they were not able to immediately compete in the NHL   From one perspective  they re a team who is only two years removed from a playoff run  and who look to bring in a few new prospects who should help for next year   Another perspective is that they are a team who had a lucky year in      and really are not that good   I think it s more of the latter and that it will take them a few years to contend   The fact that their AHL team won the Calder Cup is a good sign  but I certainly have doubts about the quality of their NHL squad   I think they are also slightly like Edmonton  in that they need to work on finding their identity   All of the other successful teams who play a big  bruising style play in the west  and it might be that they need to transition to a quicker style to play with the teams in the East   This might actually be backed up by the fact that Columbus wasn t that bad when they played teams from the West  beating   of the   playoff teams   On top of this  they only have a positive record against one playoff team from the East  who also happened to be the eight seed Flyers   This big style was chosen while they were still in the west  and they just might have to complete a full switch if they want to succeed anytime soon   It sounds bad  but I think in order for Columbus to become a winner  they need to have fewer Folignos and Jenners  and add more Hagelins and Donskois   ,Rating Every NHL

431,Alright  so I ve had a lot of success so far with my posts and I m really happy about it   Each post gets around     upvotes which is really surprising for me   If you really like my content  I would appreciate it if you would share it to your friends   I work hard on these posts and it would be great if I could get a larger audience   Today s team is the Calgary Flames    Past  They started out in Atlanta which makes this the first team on our list to have relocated   Not sure if I should include history before relocation  but for the Flames I ll touch on them briefly   The Atlanta Flames history stats out with their name   Their name comes from General Sherman s March to the Sea in which he  a general of the Union  led Union troops from Atlanta to Savannah  burning and destroying everything in their way   His march began with the city of Atlanta which was destroyed by Sherman s troops   The city was destroyed so badly that Sherman said   Behind us lay Atlanta  smoldering and in ruins  the black smoke rising high in air  and hanging like a pall over the ruined city    The name  flames  thus stuck because it totally makes sense to name a team after an event which is quite possibly the lowest point in history of the state   I can t be the only one who thinks it s really odd to name a team after this event    Their hockey history in Atlanta was short lived despite not being all that bad   After five straight playoff appearances  they were forced to move to Calgary because their owners lacked money   The team did well in Calgary  winning their only cup in       They also made the infamous Brett Hull trade which was absolved when they won the cup the next season   Throughout the rest of their history they ve had a few legends in Mike Vernon  Theo Fleury  and Jarome Iginla   After the cup  they had a bit of a down period but managed to get back to the final in       producing the memorable Iginla v  Lecavalier fight   In more recent history  they traded Iginla to Pittsburgh in an attempt to rebuild and give their captain a chance at a cup   Their short history has produced some good stories and memorable moments   Overall their history is really not that bad  but could use another cup or two          Present  The Flames are one year removed from a playoff run  but took a few steps backwards this year   They have stars like Giordano  Gaudreau  and Monahan   Their core is comprised of players under    with the exception of Giordano and Wideman   After their playoff run  they realized that they really needed to step up if they wanted to beat the Sharks and Kings again   This prompted the Hamilton trade  but was not supplemented by anything else and caused Calgary to lose their step on the California teams    Going into this past season  they had a rock solid d corps with Giordano  Brodie  Hamilton  Russell  and Wideman  but also featured a glaring hole at goalie   They chose to ride on Karri Ramo  Jonas Hiller  and Joni Ortio which proved to be a terrible decision   Calgary s defensemen had a reputation of being high scoring  but also a reputation for being a great d corps   This was shattered during the season  when Calgary was light up for the most goals in the entire league   I think that their defensemen are good enough  but they lack forwards who can play the defensive side of the game   I think if they really mixed up their bottom six  that they would be able to bring in guys who are good penalty killers  who would supplement their elite scorers   They had a top    offense led by their big guns in Gaudreau  Monahan and Giordano  but this was overshadowed because they couldn t keep the puck out of their net   Fun fact  that is and will be the only time  Gaudreau  and  big  are found in the same sentence   Unfortunately for Calgary  they were not able to get Hudler to be anywhere near what he was in            and were forced to trade him to Florida   Luckily for Calgary  they have a great cap situation  with their only issue being Giordano s monster contract   Beyond that  they have plenty of space to make moves  assuming Monahan and Gaudreau don t start getting paid the same as Toews and Kane   Overall  they are a team with a major hole  and appear to be capable of making a run for a wild card spot if they can patch this glaring hole          Future  Calgary has a bright future   Luckily for them  they have a rather young core  and look set to bring more quality rookies   Shinkaruk  Kylington  and Klimchuk look to be three players who can contribute to the Calgary roster in the not so distant future   This makes the jersey manufacturers happy because this will result in mass production of the letter  k    I really admire the toughness of Shinkaruk to play through a torn labrum in his hip and become the final cut to team Canada s      World Juniors roster   On top of their prospects they have the  th pick in the draft this year   Their biggest strength in the future is their cap space   They have all the space in the world to land some high profile free agents who might be attracted to the idea of playing for an up and coming team   Someone like Matt Martin would be able to add a lot to their bottom six and also would be someone who could find money in Calgary that wouldn t be offered elsewhere   It must be said  however  that the ability to spend and the desire to spend are two entirely different things   I think that Calgary would definitely be able to spend in free agency to address their bottom six  but the goalie position proves to be a different problem   They have no goalies signed for the next season  and also have three picks in the second round   It would not be surprising at all if Calgary acquired a goalie like Fleury with some or all of these picks   Last year  they managed to land Dougie Hamilton for a first and two seconds   It s hard to imagine Pittsburgh saying no to Fleury for two seconds among lesser assets   Overall  I think Calgary needs their prospects to develop  they need to acquire a goalie who can be a true starter  and they need to acquire a few role players in order to contend for a wildcard spot   I think this will happen soon as well          Bottom Line  Calgary gets an       which is tied for the current lead along with Toronto   I said before that    would be around the average  which I still think will be true   I think Calgary is only a few pieces away from being able to contend with the central teams for the two wild card spots   They really need to get secondary production along with a real goalie   They have the core set to contend in the future  but now they need to fill the spaces around it   I think that with good management  they could be a contender in this upcoming season   All in all  they re a solid franchise who looks to take a major step forward in the next two years  ,Rating Every NHL Team     Calgary Flames,nhl

440,It has come to my attention that this post was deleted for whatever reason   Thankfully I save all of my work and can upload it again   Here is the post in its entirety with only some small formatting edits    First I would like to send my prayers to the Howe family  and friends of the legend we ve lost today  Next  I want to say that my first post went a lot better than I thought it would  The last thing I want to say is that the  Present  section is becoming more of a  Past Few Years and Next One or Two Years  section  This gives me more to talk about and also makes more sense than talking about the exact roster a team has on this given day  Without further ado  the Edmonton Oilers are on the chopping block today        Past    This is the part that Oilers fans love  and rightfully so  The Oilers history can be summed up pretty well by simply stating  Wayne Gretzky   It goes without saying that he is the greatest player to ever put on skates  and that he is a massive piece of the history of the Oilers  To be fair  players like Coffey  Kurri  and Messier were key to the Oilers success  however it s very hard to argue that their history isn t defined by the player who has had   of the top    spots on the list of most points in a season  With The Great One  the Oilers won   Cups  and then one more cup  two years after he was traded  This sheds some light on the thought that the Oilers were more than just a one player team  Unfortunately for Oilers fans reading this  there is more to their history than their dynasty in the    s  Other than an impressive  upset filled run to the      final  the Oilers really haven t had any success recently  This is probably a result of their drafting  which I ll touch on in the next section  Overall  it s pretty impressive to say you have the best player ever and to have a dynasty to think about             Present    The Oilers present will forever be marked as a stretch of terrible drafting  High selections were wasted on players like Jesse Niinimaki  Alex Plante  and Magnus Paajarvi Svensson  If you want a fun challenge  try and pick the most painful draft since      for the Oilers  You ll probably be stuck deciding between      and       In the      draft they traded down from    to     This does t seem like that bad of a drop when you consider they got a late second round pick in return  but when you look and see that Zach Parise  Ryan Getzlaf  and Brent Burns were all taken in that range  it is a major drop  To make matters worse  the Oilers chose Marc Antoine Pouliot who has    points in     NHL games  In       they had   first round picks acquired through trades  They ended up taking Sam Gagner at   which seems like a terrible choice considering Jakub Voracek was the next pick  At    they took Alex Plante who has    career NHL games  and then at    they chose Riley Nash one pick over Max Pacioretty  These two brutal drafts added to the plethora of other failed drafts have killed the Oilers in a league where success is clearly correlated with drafting success  The Oilers have had terrible teams since then  and in turn have had a top    selection in    of the last    drafts  The Oilers reward for failed drafting was determined to be more high draft picks  This seems rather cruel to Oilers fans who have long forgotten about their glory days  All this draft failure has led to some good players like Taylor Hall  Leon Draisaitl  and of course Connor McDavid  People like to say that the Oilers biggest problem is their lack of defense  but what is forgotten is that they also struggle to score  This past season they had both a bottom   offense and defense  and this year isn t much of an aberration  This will surely change if they can get a full season of Connor McDavid  but with the lack of depth scoring  lack of a solid D corps  and absence of a true number   goalie  it is hard to imagine that the Oilers are remotely close to success  At the end of the day  their current team does have some of the most exciting  young  offensive stars in the game  Overall  the present Oilers get a generous       with most of their score coming from Connor McDavid        Future    The future of the Oilers could really go one of two ways  In one universe  the Oilers get a full season of Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl as a lethal one two punch down the middle  The Oilers also see a solid season from Taylor Hall  watch their return for Nail Yakupov contribute  and see Andrej Sekera remind them why they signed him to a   year      million contract when he was already    years old  On top of all this  the Oilers also see their other prospects develop well and look more and more like serviceable NHL players  On the other hand  Connor McDavid doesn t develop because he is continually being hurt by their division s big men such as Dustin Byfuglien  Brent Burns  and new kid on the block Erik Gudbranson  The Oilers spend their season regretting not making any changes to their current roster and continue to be a bottom   team in offense  defense  and record  Then the cycle repeats itself of bad season    high draft pick    player who doesn t help the team enough to have a good season  I really do think that the Oilers are on the way up  but not that far up  I think that they ll need to acquire more puck moving defensemen  either from the Yakupov return or through free agency  The biggest problem that I see is that the three California teams are too big and too good to be removed from a playoff spot any time soon  This forces the Oilers to contend for a wild card spot which is going to be contested by pretty much every central team  St  Louis and Chicago look like pretty good bets to stay contenders for a long time which doesn t help the Oilers case  Overall  I think the Oilers need too many teams to get worse in order for them to make the playoffs anytime soon  While I do think that McDavid will soon be a top    point getter  it s really hard to imagine that it helps the Oilers stay in the playoff race through the trade deadline  For them to be good  I think they ll need to get a Bishop or Fleury along with a new d corps  I think they need to address the fact that their defense cannot move the puck anywhere near the ability demanded by their fast  skilled forwards  If they can finally commit to becoming a quick  puck moving team  I think they ll see some real progress             Bottom Line    The Oilers get a       which is less than the Leafs  but is clearly carried by the dynasty  Without Gretzky  I honestly question whether the Oilers would be above a     For the sake of Oilers fans  I genuinely hope that they become at least average sometime soon  Unfortunately for them  their glory years are completely

215,Over half of the tackles on heads this season have been completely ignored after it s been reviewed that the receivers head was down  Some of these tackles weren t even penalized   Yes  players need to learn to keep their heads up  but that s simply never going to be the case  especially when you have rookies stepping up and sometimes even experienced players out of exhaustion and concentration forget to keep their head up   First and foremost it should be reviewed whether the player performing the tackle saw the receiver have his head down  Several of the tackles come from long way out  giving the professional hockey player more than enough time to avoid the head contact   Concussion is NOT a joke  Whether it comes from an intentional tackle or an intentional tackle because it was  legally intentional head contact   this needs to end  If a head contact is intentional  head down or head up  it must be penalized    Find other ways to steal the puck  use your professional hockey player skills to do that  You don t need to possibly end one players career in doing so   Many fans demand more physicality and are already blaming the NHL for taking the  soft way   but they forget that this is not a barbaric sport  If you really want to see people knock their brains out  watch UFC or some other sport like that  Hockey is a different sport , Keep your head down  needs to end,nhl

319,Im not one to blame the refs for losses  And dont know if this has been discussed already  But I do think that if presumably the Islanders lose the series  it would be sad that they lost   games in a row due to non calls in the play directly before the goal  First one being blatant second being en elbow knowing boychuk over   Though the second really was made worse due to lack of stick  but the point remains  Does anyone else feel a bit off about such a close series being determined by what could have been game changing non calls    Also can someone explain the rule regarding that high stick non call  They stopped play due to the high stick injury to Kyle Okposo in the third  But then they didnt hand out any penalty  Not sure whether it was called dead due to them calling delayed penalty and isles taking possession or if it was called dead due to injury  But either way was that just a terrible call or was there actual rule book reasoning behind it   In other words  play got called dead after a guy got his teeth practically knocked in by a stick but no penalty is called  The ref obviously saw what happened  so on ehat grounds would they not give out the penalty  This hit confused me as it didnt seem to be a case of the ref not seeing  He was next to them and blew the whistle ,Isles Bolts last   over times,nhl

361,Was watching the Penguins   Caps game  I m not a fan of either team  I particularly DISlike the Penguins   so this isn t some homer whining  Anyhow seeing   Delay of Game penalties in a row got me thinking about what I think of the rule    In theory I don t mind the rule  it s not unfair  and it s objective enough  except that I dislike when a game hinges on something like this  It just doesn t seem on par with other penalties like tripping  slashing  etc  The punishment seems a bit severe to me    I think it also sucks that it isn t reviewable  since they get the call wrong fairly often  Of course that would delay the game even more   What do you think of the rule  What would you do with it  Some suggestions        Leave it how it is     Leave it how it is but make it a shorter penalty  like   minute      Leave it how it is  but make the penalty can t stack with other penalties  the penalty would be served sequentially instead of removing an additional man      Make it a penalty only if the refs think it s obviously intentional     Make it the same thing as icing     Something else   I kind of lean toward    personally ,Your thoughts on the delay of game  over the glass  rule ,nhl
365,Imagine if teams were run by their fans  Just a fun thought  Instead of all of the owners  the NHL would own all of the teams and there would be registered team fans that would decide the moves made by the team  For example  there are         registered Boston Bruins Fans  Those fans can only vote on issues involving the team that they are registered for  Those fans decide things in a similar way that politics works  We vote for the Gm s to represent the team  We vote for the coaches of our teams  We vote for our draft picks  The Gm s that we appoint propose trades and signings and the registered fans vote yes or no  Or the fans can create petitions that a certain amount of fans would need to sign to be considered    I definitely don t have all of the kinks and possible scenarios thought out but I just want to hear some of your opinions about this  Just a fun proposal to think about ,Hypothetical Situation,nhl

234,OPINION  As a Canadian hockey fan rooting for one of the Canadian teams that hasn t won a Stanley  we know who we are   I ve had many a conversation with rival hockey fans and friends who love to say that no matter what happens  they re team is better than mine because they ve got their name on Stanley s Mug   Fair Enough   I wish our franchise could say the same  and once you ve won it  that s the glory of it  You can always say that your team has joined the likes of great and storied franchises such as the Carolina Hurricanes and the Tampa Bay Lightning  okay maybe that was a cheap shot on the new teams    However  the worst offenders for the  at least we have a cup  retort are IMO  Oilers fans  Because they had A DYNASTY  Not to mention every record in the book held by the big G  Gotta give that team credit    cups in   finals in   years   dominance almost without parallel in league history   Now  I m sad to say  the oilers are also perhaps the greatest dynasty of losing the NHL has ever seen   What makes them a Dynasty of Losing  Where once they had   cups in   years  now the oilers have ZERO playoff appearances in TEN YEARS  tied for a league record   Yet  unlike other famous losers of NHL history  they ve have an unprecedented   first overall picks in   years   An entire generation of the top prospects  lets just say  underachieving in the same city  You can sing praise to the potential each of their top picks have shown from time to time  Hall in particular  but can you really argue that after what Tavares did for one of the other great dynasties of failure  the New York Islanders  and the way Toews and Kane turned around what was  not long ago  one of the worst teams in the league  and then there s Crosby and the once terrible penguins   the Oilers have any excuse for what the lack of any promise they ve shown year after year   I m saying all this because  with the second coming on McJesus  I think  God  I even hope  that the oilers may soon be a very strong team and with talent like him on the roster for the next decade  it would be a shock to see him not pull home a cup  So before the Oilers become what may be another potential great dynasty  I think we need to remember right now how low they sunk  and how they are already in their franchise s second dynasty  A dynasty of Failure   TL DR  A playoff drought of    years and   first overall picks with nothing to show for it is an incredible a streak as the      s era Oilers  and should be called a Dynasty of Failure ,It s time to call the current Edmonton Oilers what they are  A Dynasty,nhl

283,When two teams are tied in total points earned  the first tiebreaker is  regulation and overtime wins   ROW    However  is this a legitimate way of breaking a tie instead of head to head  especially in your own division   I mention this because the Bruins and Red Wings finished tied for  rd in the Atlantic Division  and the Bruins won   of   meetings   If head to head was the tiebreaker  the Bruins would be in the playoffs  and the Red Wings would be out   But because the NHL uses ROW  the Red Wings get in while the Bruins are out   Putting recent team performances aside  I m a Bruins fan  and they did NOT deserve to get into the playoffs based on the way they played on Sat   would you agree with me that it isn t fair that a team that beat a division rival   times in the regular season doesn t make the playoffs because of this  ROW  nonsense  while the other team gets in ,NHL tiebreaking procedure   is it fair ,nhl

237,I admit it  I m a hater  Back in the late    s and early      s when the Clarke V Lindros soap oprea was going down I was firmly team Clarke  Even today I am still bitter towards Eric Lindros and really sadden when I think what could have been   All through out his career problems followed him  from coaches or management or the media he seem to get under all of their skin  He let his ego and selfishness slow and hurt his career  That being said the thing that I always forgot is he was still only a    year old kid when his time with the Flyers imploded  Also after all that was said about him very few of his teammates ever said a bad word about him and most said they loved him   Now that we got all that out of the way I want to make a case that he does indeed belong in the Hockey Hall of Fame   You look at his career numbers     points in     games and it is impressive  From a period between      and      he scored     points in     games which is just under a point and a half per game  Also in that period he could just dominate at the offensive end of the ice and take over games  Teams needed to game plan around him and his line   I d also argue that in a three season period from           he was one of the top   players in the NHL he also won one hart trohpy and finsihed  rd another season in this time period   Now compare him to hall of famers Mike Modano  Joe Nieuwendyk and Mats Sundin  All three players were very good and scored over     goals and close to a point per game  However in any season in their careers would you say they were the best play at their position or even in the top    Lindros was scary good at his peak and as I touched on earlier his end with the Flyers came     Due to injuries we never even really got what he could have done in his prime years        when most guys are at their peak   Look at Cam Neely  His career was slow and stopped by injuries  Neely scored     points in     games and is in the Hockey Hall of Fame   The Hall of Fame is suppose to be a place that rewards a players career on the ice not a place to punish a player for being hard to handle off of it  I think that Lindros not getting voted in this year would be an injustice to the sport  ,A Case For Eric Lindros,nhl

386,First  I am a long time hockey fan  Growing up in Detroit  I watched the Wings go from the Dead Wings to one of the  if not THE  greatest franchises in sports  I played in many hockey leagues growing up  As a result  I am one of the biggest fans of the sport that I know   I recently moved across country  and purchased NHL TV so I could continue to watch my team out of market now  As expected  and with the other streaming sports packages  local and nationally broadcast games are blacked out    What was not expected was the additional black out of games shown on the NHL cable networks    The end result is the black out of           of Red Wings games  even while out of market   I gave it some time to see if this black out rate was exceptionally high due to a small sample size  After a couple months of the same result  I reached out to customer support to see about a refund  This would indeed suck as it would guarantee I will not see any of the playoff chase  even in the rare event that I am allowed to stream a game  I was hoping maybe a prorated amount would be appropriate  Unfortunately my request for a refund was denied  I suppose it s the customer s responsibility to read and understand all the fine print details  I subscribed to both the MLB and NBA packages this last year  and was able to watch nearly every game  unless they were playing the local team    I am pretty salty about this whole experience to be honest  In the end I really feel taken advantage of  I really wish the NHL would take a cue from some of the more consumer friendly services out there  Netflix comes to mind   I have a product I don t want  without the possibility of a refund    TLDR  For those on the fence about getting NHL TV this next year  cross your fingers than NHL network  or other cable only channels  doesn t pick up your team s games  because they will be blacked out     Out of pure frustration  I will update this every time I am inconvenienced by a black out   if I remember    no promises  Keep in mind these are for an out of market viewer  with no local television option  who has spent       to stream online              blackout            blackout            blackout            blackout       I had a whole list before  I think I deleted it when I was told I couldn t get a refund anyways  ,Terrible NHL TV experience,nhl

246,Alright  from the comments  articles  interviews and all the other garbage about this gentlemanly fellow that I ve read in the last   months  John Scott seems like a swell guy  If I was an individual  like I m sure so many of you on Reddit are  who was completely ignorant to the sport of hockey  and I started following news coverage within the last    days  I d probably think he was some new hero too  Anything and everything released about this guy makes him sound like a wronged anti hero  It s bullshit  I ve known this guys name for a few seasons now  and not from any stories about him being a loving father  husband  teammate  protector  enforcer  This guy was a goon  a headhunter  a disgrace to the game  A man traded more times than he has total points   Really what I m getting to is  this whole fucking weekend was molded to go around not hurting a    year old mans feelings    We wronged Scott   Everyone deserves a shot at the ASG  Are you serious  Look up Kessel Scott  Look up Milbury rant on Scott  Look up Scott  Headshot  Knee   Look up something on this guy from more than   months ago  and shut the hell up calling him some new age hero  bringing a facelift to Allstar weekend that was desperately needed   A facelift to Allstar weekend was needed  hence the changing of the format  which was awesome   Curious how Scotts team wins it all too  then he takes MVP  I get the game doesn t stand for anything  I understand that  What I don t understand is why the FUCK you would pull a goalie with      left down by   in   on   format unless you weren t planning on winning in the first place   Hey  people  getting annoyed at people calling him what he is on live tv  THOSE PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY RE TALKING ABOUT  How about instead of getting your info on a     oaf on ice from TMZ you get it from guys who grew up alongside the greats  Men who played with real enforcers  guys who could play the puck and throw hands if need be   Scott was given warnings  Given advice  direction  suggestions  Still decided he wanted to go because   What  Some childhood dream  Making his kids proud  He s a pro hockey player  is that not enough  Oh  are they not proud of a guy who s been waived more times this season than he has played games  They need some sort of reassurance  Or does he  Is this just to let himself know  I deserve to be here   If he had done what he did to Kessel ANYWHERE other than on the ice  he d deserve to be in a jail cell for assault   For those of you new to hockey  here         Let me remind you  Scott is      one inch shorter than Chara  He s stupid big  so to go after Kessel like that in a preseason game    It s barbaric  I don t blame Kessel for whacking the shit out of him  The other video is the headshot he took on Louie Errikson  and this final video is Milbury s rant on him  because Milbury is QUALIFIED       Fuck all of you Go Preds ,John Scott  Before ASG Voting he was Irrelevant  Now Viewed as a Hero  Are you guys fucking kidding me ,nhl

256,Yeah  I know  everyone from NA knows this for a long time  but for me  as European  who almost never had heard a thing from him  I didn t have my own opinion  nor I understood the hate   But  all the clips from ASG  the NHL live coverage  all the interviews    He just had to put in everyone s face that   John is usually known about using his hands in different way  especially  hitting people   and that kind of shit  He just has to make some controversy and stir some useless crap up  doesn t he    It was just as cringy as the guy who described John Scott s line as   doughnut  with a hole in a middle    they really are classless cunts and tried to show John as a person who really doesn t belong in this type of events  They could ve taken people side  instead of partying by the rules  which were made when NHL tried to push John out of the game   I m so happy about the legit smiles and happiness in faces of Burns  Pavelski  Kane and other players  which really just showed that John is amazing person  and everyone enjoyed him being there ,Pierre McGuire is a frickin moron ,nhl

287,      Miles   John Scott All Star MVP  I ll admit it  At first   I was probably the biggest John Scott hater there could be   yes  even more than Phil Kessel    I didn t believe that goons deserved to be in the All Star game  I didn t believe that Scott   a player who has never played more than    games in a season should be allowed to participate  I didn t think that Scott   a    year old Edmonton boy with five goals in     NHL games played deserved to hang out in Nashville among the leagues superstars  I didn t think that Scott   a family man with two young children with twins on the way   deserved a chance to stick it to the NHL  I was fully convinced that John Scott was the bad guy in all of this   Was I ever wrong   None of this was Scott  s fault  Blame the fan vote before you blame Scott   Don t get me wrong   I m still fully against having the fan vote the way it is now  Create a list of eligible players that can be voted for and go from there  It s not Scott s fault that he was selected to the game  He didn t ask to be voted for  Heck  at one point he told people to vote for people more deserving than himself   The All Star weekend was about John Scott   The normally boring All Star game can thank John Scott for bringing a storyline into the fold   Previously asked by Arizona and the NHL to bow out of the All Star game  he refused and was traded to Montreal  inevitably  St  John s  seemingly taking care of any chance Scott had of going to the All Star game   Nice try   The NHL did it s damnedest to try and keep Scott away from the party in Nashville  Everything from telling him he couldn t wear his requested AHL St  John s Ice Caps jersey and forcing him to wear a team less sweater  to someone in the NHL asking Scott if his kids would be proud of him  You re telling a guy who made a living with his fists what to do and not do  Probably not a smart choice   At the end of the day  the All Star game is a laugh  It s a chance where players can put on mullets and pretend to be someone else  It s a time where players can wear a Chewbacca mask and bring their son on the ice  It s a time where all the feel good stories come out about all the players participating  It s an event that players bring their families to   It s the All Star game   They play an exhibition game  They have a skills competition  None of this means anything in the grand scheme of the rigorous    game NHL season   It did mean something to John Scott though  A    year old journeyman who punched his way through     NHL games  An Edmonton boy with a wife and two kids while also expecting twins  A player sent       miles away from his previous NHL team s arena to his new AHL arena to try and rid him from an exhibition game that he was voted into   A player who was told that his kids wouldn t be proud of him  ,      Miles   John Scott All Star MVP,nhl

302,First off  I don t actually believe this  but I think it s a fun theory    Full disclosure  marijuana was involved    Suppose that one day someone in the NHL s marketing department was brainstorming ways to increase hockey s popularity  And he has a genius plan  He goes straight to Bettman because he needs to keep it quiet     Listen Gary  I ve got a way we can create a public spectacle  We ll bribe someone in the IT department to falsify the all star voting to look like a total goon won the ballot     Gary is not amused  He has a business to run  This is a childish antic  But marketing guy has more  We re not just going to leave it at that  We re going to turn it into an epic David and Goliath battle  We re going to turn a guy nobody has really heard of into a symbol for the blue collar  go to work to support your family man    So they think about who they might use for this and go through a few tough guys  but most of them are dicks and nobody would get excited about them  They drop it at that  but a couple days later Gary remembers the time he saw an interview with John Scott and it seemed he was a nice guy  He looks into it further  Dude has   kids and his wife is pregnant with twins  Juicy     So then it just becomes a matter of making themselves look like complete assholes  He talks his friend in the GM office in Montr al into making a trade for him at just the right  wrong  time  Then he  pressures  him into not going  Just enough so that John actually says   yeah  you re right   I don t deserve it   send my teammates   But he just lets it stew for a while and waits for the exact right time to call him up and give him the line about his daughters not being proud  Now they really look like dicks and everyone  John included  wants to stick it to them     Fast forward to the all star game   he gets a couple goals  they name him MVP  and a game that nobody usually gives a fuck about  admit it you guys  you all usually ignore the all star game  suddenly has great ratings and has people sharing a bunch of shit on facebook about hockey instead of the usual Donald Trump jokes  Now we re all super engaged in time for the playoff run    I know it  probably  didn t happen this way  But goddam it is genius if it did ,John Scott conspiracy theory ,nhl

311,So  you thought that it was just your imagination   I thought it might be      I grew up in the   s  when hockey was high flying fun    Nowadays  it seems more like work most nights  and the goal scoring just doesn t seem to be there     Well  I looked it up       We haven t had this few goals per game since       when sticks were straight  and skates were made from wood       Is there anything to be done  or is this downward spiral of less and less goals going to end with us  enjoying    nil  hockey soccer  games      Don t get me wrong  I don t mind a nice defensive showdown   but every game is just too much   What do you guys think of this historically low scoring period  ,Goalscoring Drought,nhl
313,Somehow in the move to NHL tv some people s Gamecenter Live subscriptions  including mine  have vanished  I paid      for a year subscription and after   months it s now gone I posted on twitter yesterday s and the nhl tv suppost account immediately wrote me back  After giving my acct info  they confirmed they had no record of my subscription  Eventually it came out that if you purchased the subscription through iTunes as an in app purchase they don t have access to those accounts and you had to do a  restore previous purchases  on the app  which I did to no avail  NHL did not think this through  If they don t have access to any accounts not purchased through the NHL website  what s going to happen when you completely revamp the system  Finally nhl said I d have to contact iTunes customer service  I contact iTunes customer service and spent    minutes talking with them  with them definitely trying to figure out if they can restore my subscription  they finally determine that only the developers of the app  NHL com  can restore in app subscription purchases  Has anyone had this problem and has had it fixed or knows what I can do to get my subscription back   Edit  SOOO it took uninstalling and reinstalling the app on my iPad      times before  when it first starts up  a little button that says  restore previous purchase  popped up  Finally got it to work on my iPad  uninstalled and reinstalled it on my phone and it finally worked on that  Went to the website  Logged in and out a couple times and it finally worked but when I click on  My Account  it still says I don t have a subscription  I can watch some games  but there doesn t seem to be any commonalities between the games I can t watch         I did find a workaround for archived games  If you go the the team website  ie sharks nhl com  and you go to the schedule tab and click on video there  it ll take you to the old gamecenter with icetracker and boxscore and the old video player ,NHL site update issue GCL issue,nhl

0,Casual fan here that doesn t want to see the size of the nets changed   Odd man rushes are down  Shot blocking is up   Goalie assists are down   Goalies taking risks playing the puck is down    I believe if the blue lines are reset to where they were just a few years ago we will see the following  Defencemen in the O zone will face more pressure increasing turnovers resulting in more odd man rushes   Less low quality attempted shots from the point   Wingers chasing the puck on the dump and chase will be more effective with a larger neutral zone    Remove the trapezoid  Let goalies try to stop the dump and chase   Goalies should be allowed to assist more with breakouts  They should be allowed to make mistakes    This would be easy to implement    Thoughts ,Increase scoring in the NHL proposal,nhl

100,I ve been on various hockey forums the last few weeks  including this subreddit  long time lurker  and their are a number of fans whom seem to be angry about the whole John Scott voting  I do understand someone like John Scott does not deserve to be in an All Star Game because that term  All Star  has now lost its credibility when looking at the list of previous All Stars   The NHL has already changed the All Star Game so many times these last couple of years that it is not your  father s All Star Game   hell it s not even your  older brother s All Star Game  anymore   This week is mainly for the fans that is why the Cities that host it have week long events now and the fans get to vote the players in  So with that being said  I believe the NHL should change  All Star Game  to Fan Appreciation Series  since it is going to be a series of games and skills competition   I love the idea of that we the fans are making a legend out of John Scott  it is hilarious and fun but I do not believe this guy should go down in history as an All Star Selection   Please take this post seriously and not comment  Well John Scott is a legend what are you talking about   Just a thought that came to mind these last couple of days  ,Changing the  All Star  Game,nhl

247,I live in the U K I m planning on watching a bunch of hockey this year so     of my decision will be based on that  But I was hoping this could narrow down the field a little and help me out so instead of watching multiple games from every team I could focus on just   or        I ve been a basketball fan from a very young age  Didn t really have a team until I was    when I decided to start back Golden State  J Rich be damned  paid off in the end I guess      When I was about       I followed the NHL for a season or two  usually backing the New York Rangers because     They were one of the few teams who s games were aired over here     They were a New York team and I had heard of them  My sudden interest in the NHL when I was       was purely from watching the Mighty Ducks haha     They stopped airing NHL and I lost interest  Some subscription based sports channels brought back the NHL years ago and I never paid it much interest    But now I m feeling like I want to give it another shot and I find having someone to back makes it easier to get into a sport  Something to cheer for    Rough idea of what I m looking for      Not a contender  I love an underdog  Part of the reason I was drawn to the Warriors back in the day      Not the worst team in the league  My interest and passion for the game isn t there  I couldn t back a team that is doing absolutely nothing and showing no signs of improving  I don t need a playoff team at all  Would rather they weren t actually  But I don t want the Philadelphia   ers of hockey either      Great playmaking  I don t know why  Maybe it s how I was coached as a kid when playing basketball  But I ve always loved watching great passing more than anything else  A team with a guy known for great passing or just a team with a history of great team work would be very welcome     Young talent prospects  Doesn t have to be the next MVP  Just a team with some new young players on it  I don t want to start backing a team that has a bunch of veterans who have been amazing and are now in their twilight years  Would feel like arriving really late at a party haha     This one isn t a requirement  Just a preference  But a team that has never won a championship would be nice  I ll look at teams even if they have  But I would be giving extra value to teams that havent      Again  This isn t a requirement  But a pretty relaxed fanbase would be appreciated  Can t be bothered with a bunch of whining complainers or uber arrogant idiots who cling onto the past    Thanks in advance  ,What team should I support ,nhl

374,In the NHL s points system  a regulation loss is the equivalent of not playing when it comes to sorting teams in the standings   Let s say Detroit is           That s    points   They lose four straight games   They re still at    points   So what they re really looking at is a record of    x   where x  or number of losses  doesn t matter     Furthermore  let s say the Bruins are         and the Rangers are           In the NHL  the Rangers   at           would be listed ahead of the Bruins   Now let s say the Red Sox are       and the Yankees are         The Red Sox at       would be listed ahead of the Yankees     Some have suggested the use of a points system is necessary because of the presence of ties  or overtime losses    This isn t true  as a tie or overtime loss has the net value of half a win and half a loss   For example  let s say the Ducks are       and the Kings are         Each of the Ducks four OTLs are worth one point   But if you take each one of those OTLs and count it as half a win and half a loss  you d add two to the loss column and two to the win column such that they d be         which is the Kings record   And this can be double checked using another method to find that each team has    points in    games     This is the only sport in North America which does something like this   Does anyone know why ,Why does the NHL ignore regulation losses when it comes to sorting teams in the standings ,nhl

385,I don t really know if this kind of post is ok in this subreddit  but I would like to hear some speculation and info from people who know better than I do   Now  I am not a Penguins fan  I like the organisation because of its history  They seem to be stuck in the middle lower end of the standings this year with pretty poor performances from players who are expected to perform like all stars  which they are    I should really get to the point   could Crosby Malkin Kessel get traded in the upcoming years  And why  I myself would consider a trade involving Malkin over Crosby  as Sidney is  like it or not  the face of Penguins NHL   Crosby currently has    points in    games  Very poor for him  But Kessel and Malkin are both struggling too  with Malkin having    points in    games  and Kessel    points in    games   The point totals aren t the only reason why I wouldn t be surprised about a Crosby Malkin trade  They have a huge salary  and with Kessel and Letang  money gets tight  I would rather have a team performing well  and a team with a future  than investing all for       year old players that cost more than they are worth  atm   But I am not an expert  and I m super tired  so I wanna hear what you think  Sorry for rambling  like I said I m tired    a m  here  ,The  hypothetical  Penguins shuffle,nhl

45,I was perusing the NHL stats yesterday and noticed that teams that lost in OT were one point ahead of those teams that had lost as many in regular season   Just because teams went to OT  they are awarded one point regardless of whether they lost the game or not   This does not seem fair to me  I think if you go to OT you lose a point and fight over the remaining point   Why should each team be awarded a point for simply reaching OT   Any thoughts      oh  and I hate the goalies trapezoid   It feels like that stupid  two line pass  rule from the    s   Anyone agree disagree  ,Overtime Loss should be a loss,nhl

300,You know  that almost last ditch effort that they say to get you pumped up for the puck drop    Personally  I know it isn t an NHL game   but I think my favorite line  or at least the one that stuck with me the most  is from the Round Robin game between Canada and USA in       On the American broadcast  just before the puck dropped  Doc Emrick said a line that went something like this   He said how many people lived in the US and in Canada  and then said how many people in each country played hockey  listing the respective percentages  Then  he closed with this line    And out of those  these are the best    from each country    I don t know why  but that line just always gives me chills  probably because the full realization that this was Canadian hockey vs American hockey and it meant more than just a Round Robin game    Thoughts ,What s the best coolest line you ve heard by an announcer to set up the game you re about to watch just before puck drop ,nhl

399,So I m a Rangers fan and I don t necessarily believe CF   is that telling since the Rangers have a great offense but terrible Corsi numbers  The Rangers high shooting percentage and goal differential prove that   But I wanted to see it in one number to determine how efficient offenses in the league really are  Here s what I did      CF     Team Shooting Percentage to get Possession Plus Efficiency  PPE   I ll explain why I did this later      CF   Shooting Percentage to get Efficiency Adjusted Corsi Margin  EACM   Ideally  this number would be low since high octane offenses would have high possession numbers and high shooting percentages  so the differential between the two numbers would be small  resulting in a low margin      PPE EACM to get Efficiency Adjusted Corsi  The Reason I used PPE instead of CF   is because there could potentially be teams with low Corsi and low SP that would still have similar ratios to teams that have high figures in both categories  By adding the two together  this helps to avoid that  although not altogether  as no stat is perfect   In short  I believe this statistic can help show what teams do with their possessions  rather than merely showing whether a team possesses the puck or whether they score a lot on fewer shots  The higher this figure  the more goals offenses score when they possess the puck are creating shot attempts    Here s what I got   Team OTT        MTL       NYR        MINN        Dallas       BOS       WASH        ARI        NJ        COL        EDM        NYI        FL        VAN        SJ        WPG     DET        CHI       STL        CBJ        TB       NASH      CGY       LA       TOR      PITT       BUFF       CAR       ANA      PHI        I actually think the results are pretty telling  It makes sense that OTT is at the top  considering they re a mildly successful team yet still have mediocre Corsi  and the Rangers have terrible Corsi and are ranked third  Teams like ARI EDM COL have subpar defensemen and team SV  which helps explain why they re near the top but not doing great in the standings  And for better teams that are toward the bottom  like LAK  STL  CHI  it still makes sense because their Corsi numbers are so good that it doesn t matter how efficient their offense is because they possess the puck so much that they don t have to do well with their possessions because they re less valuable   This could very well be riddled with mistakes and be terrible overall  but I was bored  and wanted to hear thoughts from the hockey community  Let me know what I did wrong ,Efficiency Adjusted Corsi  New metric I just tested out  Thoughts ,nhl

13,Hi guys   British dude here  Back in the early      s I used to enjoy following the NHL and despite my username I am technically a Devils fan  apparently they have had a bad run recently   I got to enjoy a great period of their success and loved watching Brodeur do his thing and Scott Stevens smash the piss out of people   Anyway  as you probably all remember  the lockdown happened and after that life kind of got in the way of me keeping up to date so it all fell by the wayside  Now I have made some new friends who happen to be into hockey so am just looking to be able to chat shit with them    Are there any good resources out there that would help me understand the current state of things  what has happened recently  and keep up with what is going on  Obviously I ll be subscribing to some more subreddits and checking out the official channels but was just wondering if there are any less obvious places   Appreciate any input ,How can I  get back into  hockey,nhl

20,So  as always there has been is a debate going on which service is better   NHL GameCenter or HockeyStreams    I wanted to provide input on what I ve found having used them both so that it might help people choose    This is also putting price aside from the mix as I don t think the difference between      and      is that huge a deal  To me  its all about what works   First  NHL GameCenter   The obvious issue  lack of Chromecast support   Now  there have been rumors of it having it this year   I know the Rogers site says it has it  but the US version doesn t mention anything yet  maybe its changed in the past week but right now I haven t seen it    Either way  we ll have to wait to see if its really added this year   To me  thats its biggest knock   Everything else worked perfectly for me  but my XB  is in a different room than my main TV  so I was always running a   ft  HDMI Cable to my TV    I don t want to do that this year   However   quality  interface  and everything else about GC  was perfectly fine   I really didn t see any issues with it   If you re on the easy coast however  you will probably complain about the blackouts since everything is so close together that being a fan of a team in a different area is more likely   Me being in Vegas  and being a Sharks fan    I had no blackout issues   And I have DirecTV so if I wanted to watch Kings Ducks Coyotes games  I can and just watched the Sharks on those local or nations channels if they were playing them   Next  HockeyStreams   The idea behind HS  is really good   And for the most part it works  Quality is good  but still not quite as good as GC or normal HDTV   There was some obvious scaling going on that was a tad annoying  but I could get past it   HS has Chromecast support  which is the main reason I wanted to try it   Using Chromecast from my laptop casting to my Chromecast  was way too laggy for it to be watchable   So next I tried the app   Chromecast worked perfectly using the app to cast it  albeit after I had to close and open the app about   times until it finally worked with no issue    But this was the most functional way   My issue with the app  its pretty amateur and needs a lot of refinement  However  it does what its supposed to do   Also  at home  I have a Plex Media Server   When I discovered HS made a Plex Plugin and I could pretty much just use my Plex App to stream live hockey via HS  I was pretty excited   So I configured it and was able to see the games  browse and play them   Playing them directly from the Plex App on my phone or tablet  worked with no problem   But as soon as I tried to cast it to my Chromecast   NOPE   Unwatchable   Something doesn t quite translate there   HS does say the Plex Plugin is in beta  so it may not work right but I was hoping   If the Plex plugin worked  that would have sold me completely on HS  even accepting the slight quality degradation  but it didn t   So to me  if I want to watch a game using Chromecast  I have to use the app from my phone tablet   But at least it works   However  I couldn t find a way to switch which broadcast I watched from the app at all  so I was stuck with whatever it has   I m going to wait until the start of the season to see if GC actually has Chromecast support  doesn t look like it right now just looking at the videos section  but maybe live games will be different   Chromecast support is still the defining feature   If GC does have it  I will more than likely go back to them from HS just due to the app cleanliness and quality differences   Like I said earlier  the idea of HS and features are amazing    but a lot of them are executed poorly and half done   Also  in case anyone was wondering if the issues with HS could be from my local network setup LAN speeds   there s no issues there   Router and laptop both AC     on a  Ghz network   Even tried from my desktop which is wired with the same issues happening   Tested streaming a   GB  mkv from Plex App as well from the same laptop and there was no latency issues like on HS game feed   This isn t meant to convince anyone that one is better than the other     these are just my observations between the two   Oh  NHL Center Ice is there too  its shit ,The Gamecenter vs Hockeystreams Debate  My findings experience,nhl

81,Montreal fan here      Alex Galchenyuk will see increased responsability this year  He has been moved to center and will play on the top lines  Look for him to have a large increase in points this year     Semin won t do a classic semin     point season  but for  M cap hit  he should easily bring in over    which is pretty good  Would not be surprised to see him around        Desharnais will probably be the loser of the Galchenyuk situation  He will most likely spend most of the season centering the  rd line with Dale Weise and Fleishmann     Michel Therrien  coach  seems to have changed the offensive scheme and it s a lot more dynamic and involves the defensemen a lot  Look for montreal to score more goals this year      goals last year  I expect them around     this year      Subban  Petry  Markov and Beaulieu all have good value if you re looking for points  as I said  defensemen will be VERY involved in our team s offense  However  if you play with salary cap        for Markov probably isn t worth it  BUT  look out for Beaulieu  at  M he s a really good deal  LARGE IMPROVEMENT THIS YEAR      Speaking of improvements  Subban spent the whole summer TRAINING with Ben Johnson and barely took any vacation  I m looking for him to show increased numbers since the total goals from montreal will go up and he will be involved in most      There won t be any youngster popping out of nowhere and doing lots of points this year     Price will likely see decreased numbers in GAA and S  but I expect his Wins to stay similar ,Talk to me about your team from a hockey pool perspective,nhl

37,I know for me personally  I really like what s being done with the Red Wings and Avalanche game and the Bruins   Canadiens game  so here s my picks   Dallas Stars   Minnesota Wild   All these two teams need is a playoff series against each other to really ignite what could be an amazing rivalry  Both teams play similar styles and  more importantly  they have a serious history between the two organizations  I feel like this would be a fun game to watch  especially if both teams use throwbacks to reference the Minnesota North Stars   NY Islanders vs  NY Rangers   no home team  no away team  And the brilliance of this is that the Islanders were on fire last year  hopefully they can continue that success this upcoming year  and the Rangers could be on a decline this season  allowing for this game to be a hard fought fight to the death as these two teams would be evenly matched for the first time in the past couple of seasons   Ottawa Senators vs  Montreal Canadiens  in the nation s capital    following the previous two playoff series this teams have had against each other  this would be a fun one to watch  A rivalry is there and I expect it to continue to grow as both franchises have players come into their primes   Who would you pick  And why ,If you were in charge of the next Winter Classic or Stadium Series  which teams would you choose and where ,nhl

45,With Las Vegas and Quebec being the only two expansion candidates  it becomes almost impossible to balance two conferences divided up into East and West  My solution  Add in Northern and Southern Conferences  Let s get the two messy conferences out of the way first   WESTERN CONFERENCE    Pacific   Anaheim  Los Angeles  San Jose  Vancouver  Mountain   Arizona  Calgary  Edmonton  Las Vegas  This is no more than the current Pacific divided up into the actual Pacific Time Zone and the Mountain Time Zone  Las Vegas is in there because someone said on my last realignment plan that Las Vegas and Arizona would make a good rivalry  That and Nevada as a state is counted as the Mountain West region   SOUTHERN CONFERENCE    Southwest   Colorado  Dallas  Nashville  St  Louis  Southeast   Carolina  Florida  Tampa Bay  Washington  Eh  This makes the most sense geographically  but with the way the schedule s set up here  the Southeast would have to have one away game two hours from their time zone  And sorry Caps fans  you guys are just the logical choice for the last team in the Southeast just because of how the other Southern teams are spread  Ah well  the messy conferences are out of the way  Let s move on to the North   NORTHERN CONFERENCE    Central   Chicago  Columbus  Minnesota  Winnipeg  Lakeside   Buffalo  Detroit  Ottawa  Toronto  Columbus loses the CST battle  but that paves the way for the Lakeside division  which  as its name implies  are teams in or close to the Great Lakes  The good news is  all Columbus s division rivals are one time zone away  so they can still air those away games on primetime   I know  Ottawa isn t really near any of the Great Lakes  But hey  Lake Ontario  and Toronto and Ottawa are both in Ontario    It s a bit of a stretch  but I decided not to discontinue the Battle of Ontario after all  and hey  I figure travel time from Detroit to Ottawa isn t that drastic if they were realigned into the same division a couple years ago   And now  all that s left is the East   EASTERN CONFERENCE    Atlantic   Boston  Montreal  Pittsburgh  Quebec  Metropolitan   Rangers  Islanders  New Jersey  Philadelphia  This is mostly just what remains of the current East after everyone s been realigned  plus Quebec  Pittsburgh and Ottawa switched  so the Penguins and the Flyers can play each other three times a year  maybe four if they stay competitive with each other   Teams play four games against division rivals           three games against their conference s other division           at least two games against the other teams            one extra game against the teams that finished the same as them in their divisions          and one game against the other three teams in a certain division that rotates each year  mostly to account for time zones           So                   Rotating divisions are   Pacific Mountain vs Southwest Central Atlantic Metropolitan vs Southeast Lakeside  Pairs don t play each other any more than the rest of the schedule dictates  The matchups are arranged for the sake of time zones   Playoffs are determined by who the top two teams in each division are  The two divisional rivals play each other to determine the division championship  and the winners play each other to determine the conference championship  From there  conference champions are seeded     in a final tournament to determine the Stanley Cup Champion   Whew  This was a lot of work  But I mostly did this for fun and to try and make sense of how the league could realign  Thoughts ,Four Conference Realignment Plan,nhl
48,Assuming that both Quebec and Las Vegas get approved  those two teams will be participating in an expansion draft prior to the         season  I believe last time teams were able to protect   forwards    defenseman  and   goalie    The purpose of a NTC is so a player has stability and knows his future for the term of his contract    Let s say a player is signed to a   yr deal today  and given a NTC for the duration  Two years down the road  this player has underperformed  or is a bust  and the team doesn t want this player anymore  and wants to shed his contract   Is the team required to protect him for the expansion draft because he has a NTC  Or can this be a way a team can potentially move someone that was so called unmoveble    It just seems like a player could have fought and argued to get a NTC into his contract  potentially taking less money to do so  only to end up in a city he didn t want to go to because he wasn t protected for the draft  ,How do NTC s work for the future expansion draft ,nhl

92,I m unbelievably excited that the Wild have an outdoor game this year  So much so that I ve been checking for tickets way more often than I really should be  Today I stumbled on ticket master and realized that there is a presale of the tickets this Wednesday  My eyes lit up and I immediately had to see who qualified for these  assuming season ticket holders first before the general public  which I m not      What do I see  Presale only available to BLACKHAWK season ticket holders  I m hoping this is a mistake because there is no way they should be selling tickets to a game played in Minnesota to an opposing team BEFORE their own crowd  Especially because everyone knows how committed the Blackhawks fan base is to traveling with their team  not like it s far to MN anyways   I m hoping that a season ticket holder can shed some light on this or that it s just a mistake    This also makes me think more about what Tampa Bay was doing during the playoffs with ticket sales  I m not saying that they should not sell any tickets to the opposing team  but letting them have first chances at tickets in your home state  in front of what should be your crowd is just a little bit ridiculous  Maybe it s because the rivalry has made me bitter against the Blackhawks these last few years  though I respect the hell out of their team and their fans from a hockey standpoint  but this just doesn t seem right ,Stadium Series Presale ,nhl

117,I m not      sure where to post this  but I knew that it needed to be said   bcproductions bc  aka Johnny Superbman is a YouTuber of nearly         subscribers primarily involved with the NHL game series and has definitely had his share of controversy in the past  Basically  due to this controversy  he has been sheltered to his own group of friends to play with while not collaborating with any other NHL YouTubers  This has basically created a divide in the NHL fan base    Now  the situation that took place in the early morning of August   th       on his website in the site s chat box  Johnny is known to be a quite heavy drinker  and he evidently had quite a bit throughout the day and night  This is not an excuse for his actions  he is known for being brutally honest no matter what state of mind he s in   This all started while his group of friends were streaming the NHL    Beta  I wasn t there to know exactly what was said  but I ve been told that he was basically digging pretty harshly into his friends  as well as his brother  A lot of the people watching were quite confused and outraged to see this behavior from him  After the stream was over  some viewers came into the chat box on his site discussing his behavior and were quite shocked  Johnny came on to his defense saying basically that it s what he does and that it was purely for entertainment s sake  I personally don t see how making fun of your friends and brother is funny or entertaining for anyone to watch  but Johnny isn t like you and me    He then went on a rant saying how he is basically the best NHL YouTuber  explaining how he is so much better  yes  I know very narcissistic   This is where I butted in  username  Banana  saying how full of himself he is to the dismay of many users  then again there were users that agreed  This went on for quite a while until Johnny said he was leaving  He also stated that in    minutes the chat box would be dead without him  which is not true   Anyway  we moved on and started talking about hockey  specifically the Los Angeles Kings defense  then    minutes he showed back up  He was basically saying that I was only talking because he came back  I denied and then this is where all the comments came to fruition  This is where Johnny was continuously calling himself a God and the fact that everyone in chat is basically nothing  This is where he said something he can never take back  He said that all his fans were his  pawns  while calling many  retards  and  losers   He stated that all we are to him is        He doesn t understand that he d be nothing without us  which is extremely unforgivable  He then insulted many users over and over again  Some of the most loyal users on the site  myself included  banded together in dismay of what he said  Many other blinded users completely ignored those comments saying  he is drunk   Being drunk had nothing to do with it  if anything it makes it truer  Johnny is known to basically only come on to the site when he s drunk and make claims like this  This went on for a few hours   Throughout this time  my account was banned by Johnny   times and luckily the moderators  which he bashed on multiple times saying they do a terrible job  were nice enough to unban me  Then it got serious  A moderator on the site banned Johnny to try and diffuse the situation and to hopefully save his reputation  Johnny woke up his brother Domski  who basically runs the site  and got him to unban him  The moderator was stripped of his moderator capabilities and basically left with nothing to try and save the site  Many users found it hard to believe that this was even truly Domski  He never acted this way and was normally compassionate towards other users  He basically allowed multiple moderators to leave the site without any sort of care in his heart  These were moderators that have been around since the beginning of the site creating it  It was a complete shame  We didn t know what to do   This went on until early in the morning    am CST  and basically showed everybody who the people behind this community truly are  He then came on later that day showing no remorse for his comments and basically spewing the same stuff he previously said   I thought this needed to be said  If you know anybody who watches Johnny then I suggest you share this with them to show them who the person they watch really is and what he thinks about them   You can read everything that went down in the chat archive  here     from this post onwards to about  am    I ve also compiled a folder of screenshots of some of the unforgivable things he said that night   note some of these screenshots are from him responding to other users   also worth nothing that Jack Myer   King K is are moderators   link    , bcproductions bc aka Johnny Superbman calls his fans  pawns     nothing but     ex post ,nhl

191,With Quebec in the final stages of the expansion process  the Eastern Conference will have    teams to the West s     The problem is     is a prime number  which makes the alignment a bit messy  and I don t think the league is gonna adopt my four conference plan  So logically  a team would have to move west  Quebec could be forced West as a new team against all common geographical sense  or Columbus could be moved purely for travel s sake    The thing is  all    teams in the Eastern Conference  current and potential  are in the Eastern Time Zone  So I thought of a few ways to make life out west easier on whatever team moves  They may be stupid ideas  or they may be brilliant  I have no way of knowing  this is just what makes sense to me   First off  for the sake of argument  I m going to use Columbus to illustrate my ideas  That said  whatever team moves absolutely HAS TO play in the Central Division  Why  Because under a    team schedule    games is the maximum per division rival  more on that in a bit   With only a   hour time difference  Columbus would play away games within the division at      EST  Still in a primetime slot  so while not ideal  it s not like you ll be up till     Now for the schedule    games against division teams             games against   non division teams                     two games against an agreed upon pair of teams  let s say Chicago and St  Louis were one pair  and LA and Anaheim were another  Each team in one pair would only play each team in the other pair twice compared to the rest of their division  whom they play three times                    and   games against every non conference team                      That would give Columbus at most    games beyond Central time  Colorado is in the Mountain Time Zone  so they re kind of an outlier    Those Pacific games that have Blue Jackets fans so worried  Play them on Saturday and Sunday afternoons  I realize it sounds overly simple  but I see no reason why it wouldn t work  Then again  I m not in charge of NHL schedules  so I really don t know   There are some who might be skeptical that moving to the West isn t as bad as it sounds  but I m just one guy trying to make sense out of a move that seemingly makes no sense ,How the League Could Accommodate a West Move,nhl

20,What is the NHL s Game Winning Goal meant to tell us   As it is seldom the goal which actually won a game  it s largely a misnomer   Take for example the Blackhawks Wild game   from the recent playoffs    st       CHI Brent Seabrook     Assists  Bryan Bickell    Johnny Oduya    CHI     MIN     nd      CHI Andrew Shaw    power play    Assists  Jonathan Toews    Patrick Kane    CHI     MIN         MIN Erik Haula     Assists  Matt Cooke    Matt Dumba    CHI     MIN     rd       CHI Patrick Kane     Assists  Bryan Bickell    Niklas Hjalmarsson    CHI     MIN          CHI Marian Hossa    short handed empty net   Assists  Jonathan Toews    CHI     MIN          MIN Jason Pominville    power play   Assists  Jared Spurgeon    Mikko Koivu    CHI     MIN          MIN Nino Niederreiter     Assists  Matt Dumba    Ryan Suter    CHI     MIN    According to the GWG stat  Hossa s goal which put the Blackhawks up     is credited as the GWG   But it didn t win the game   It merely made a     game a     game   Furthermore  since it isn t even known at the time of Hossa s goal how many more goals Minnesota will score  one cannot be sure if Hossa s goal will be necessary for the Blackhawks to win the game   One of the arguments GWG supporters give is  if Hossa didn t score  the Blackhawks wouldn t have won    If that s true  then it must be assumed that Pominville and Niederreiter still score the  nd and  rd goals for Minnesota   or that all the other scoring after Hossa s goal remains the same   So in order to distinguish Hossa s goal from the other Blackhawks goals  we must apply that same hypothesis to the Blackhawks goals of Seabrook  Shaw and Kane to see what the score would have been had any of them not scored   And if any of those three goals is removed and the remainder of the scoring stays the same  you still end up with a     game as you would if you removed Hossa s goal   So why does the NHL have the GWG stat ,What is the purpose of the NHL s Game Winning Goal stat ,nhl

26,I just got a fancy legal notice about my Gamecenter subscription   The gist of the lawsuit is this    Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated federal law by agreeing to allocate the country into exclusive territories in which certain teams would have the exclusive right to broadcast hockey games  Plaintiffs claim that this caused inflated prices for live hockey broadcasts and limited consumer options for viewing NHL hockey broadcasts  Defendants deny Plaintiffs  allegations  deny any wrongdoing  and contend that the challenged rules increased the quality and availability of NHL hockey programming  and increased consumer choice at reasonable prices  as well as providing other benefits    Reading through now to see what all this means   Any lawyer types in this sub     Under the Settlement and subject to the NHL s continued delineation of its clubs  local broadcast territorial rights  and associated blackout practices  the NHL has agreed to provide seasonal packages of single team s out of market games through NHL GameCenter LIVE for each and every NHL Club  e g   a stream of just the Chicago Blackhawks  out of market games   These individual team bundles will be priced at     below the cost of the full GameCenter LIVE package  The NHL has also agreed to make this option available to Comcast and DIRECTV so that they may offer unbundled seasonal packages of single team games for each and every NHL Club available through NHL Center Ice  although Comcast and DIRECTV are not obligated to offer such packages     Am I reading this right   I can subscribe to the full service  the lawsuit mentions a        discount now on the full package  or subscribe to a single team at     below the cost of the full package   As a Stars fan in the Stars  market  if my reading is correct  this is fantastic    The NHL has also agreed to provide a        discount to the retail prices for the early bird  renewal  and full season packages of GameCenter LIVE for the           season  This discount will also apply to any unbundled single team package  meaning that the price for a single team package will be discounted by        thereby maintaining the     discount set forth above      tl dr  Looks like the NHL got sued because the territorial blackouts and such leads to increased prices on streaming services and the NHL may have agreed to more favorable terms including an option to watch a team that was blacked out and a general price discount ,NHL Gamecenter Class Action lawsuit email  Will territorial blackouts end ,nhl

93,For those of you who don t know  Stars gm Joe Nill continued his trend of off season blockbuster trades last night by sending D Trevor Daley and F Ryan Garbutt to Chicago for LW Patrick Sharp and D Stephen Johns  While this trade certainly gives Chicago gm Bowman some cap relief to try and resign Oduya  it does raise some interesting questions for Dallas  They just lost one of their top pairing defenseman  and while Johns is a top notch prospect  he isn t ready to fill the void Daley leaves behind   We know that Nill really likes his D Core and wants to cultivate from within  which to be fair to him  is actually very reasonable  as their current D core now has   Patrik Nemeth Jamie  Big Rig  Oleksiak Julius Honka Stephen Johns  aforementioned   EDIT  Matias Backman  a highly touted defensive prospect from the Red Wings And John  the Legend  Klingberg  All of whom are very impressive  but none are ready to take that top pairing spot  despite what fans may say about Klingberg   So the top candidate to replace Daley would be Jason Demers  a right handed puck moving defenseman    So would it make sense for the stars to seek out Franson s services for say a three or four year contract to keep their D core solid  and to also help promote competition from within  something Nill likes  in order to aide the young defensemens progress ,With Daley traded for Sharp  does this put Dallas in the front running for Cody Franson ,nhl

166,Since Las Vegas and Quebec are the closest things to locks at this point in the expansion process  I figured it might be fun to mess around with realignment ideas  The simplest thing would be to send Detroit back to the Central and give Quebec their place in the Atlantic  with Vegas going into the Pacific  However  I wanted to have a little fun with this  so I m going with eight four team divisions  So  Without further delay     Northeast  Toronto  Ottawa  Montreal  Quebec  Atlantic  Boston  Buffalo  Rangers  Islanders  Metropolitan  New Jersey  Philadelphia  Pittsburgh  Washington  Southeast  Nashville  Tampa Bay  Florida  Carolina  Southwest  Colorado  Arizona  Dallas  St  Louis  Central  Detroit  Chicago  Minnesota  Columbus  Pacific  Los Angeles  Anaheim  San Jose  Las Vegas  Northwest  Vancouver  Calgary  Edmonton  Winnipeg  The Northeast is the way it is because I wanted to preserve the rivalry between Toronto and Ottawa and foster the Montreal Quebec rivalry   The Atlantic feature the Border War prominent in the other major leagues  Red Sox Yankees  Patriots Jets  Celtics Knicks Nets  and now Bruins Rangers Islanders  though the Islanders may take a backseat because of Boston and the Rangers being Original Six teams   I also wanted to preserve the Rangers Islanders rivalry  and Buffalo gets left alone   The Metropolitan teams are relatively close together  The only real rivalry that I could imagine in that division is Philadelphia Pittsburgh  and maybe Philadelphia New Jersey  Once again  Columbus is left alone   The Southeast is pretty much the old Southeast division reunited sans Atlanta Winnipeg   The Southwest is mostly the Southwestern states  plus Nashville  For the record  I never understood the Predators  place in the Western Conference and considered swapping them for Columbus   The Central is all Midwestern teams  with Detroit moved to give Chicago an Original Six rival   The Pacific is West Coast teams plus Vegas  which is technically on PST  giving the league one less time zone conflict  which they seem to worry about for whatever reason   The Northwest is all the Northwestern teams  I have mixed feelings about Winnipeg being there  but with the Central filled up and no Seattle team  something had to give   So yeah  this is how I d realign the teams  accounting for expansion into Las Vegas and Quebec  Once again  I made this for fun  and I m sorry if I pissed a lot of you off by breaking up your favorite rivalries  trust me  I m pissed that I couldn t keep Boston and Montreal in the same division   Remember  this was more about geography than anything else   The teams play   games each in the division             games each for the rest of the conference             and   games each in the other conference                          Additionally  two teams in a division will play an extra game each against either the top two or bottom two teams from another division based on the previous year s divisional standings  For example  if Boston and the Rangers finish a season first and second in the Atlantic  Montreal and Ottawa do the same in the Northeast  and the Northeast plays the Atlantic that year  then Boston and the Rangers get an extra game each against Montreal and Ottawa  while Buffalo and the Islanders would get extra games against Toronto and Quebec  bringing the total number of games to    ,Just a realignment plan I came up with for fun ,nhl

170,Here s my idea for realignment with Las Vegas and Quebec City being added      LINK       So instead of   conferences  it s   conferences       CANADIAN CONFERENCE   WESTERN CONFERENCE   EASTERN CONFERENCE   MW S  Midwest South  CONFERENCE    Each conference breaks down into two divisions     Canada West  CC    Canada East  CC                                              Edmonton   Toronto Calgary   Montreal Winnipeg   Ottawa Vancouver   Quebec City  Westside  WC    Rocky Heartland  WC                                              San Jose   Minnesota Los Angeles   Dallas Anaheim   Phoenix Las Vegas   Colorado  New Metro  EC    The Colonies  EC                                              Buffalo   Boston New York R   Washington New York I   Philadelphia New Jersey   Pittsburgh  Midwest  MSC    SEC  MSC                                              Chicago   Carolina Detroit   Nashville St  Louis   Tampa Bay Columbus   Florida    Season Structure      games vs divisional rivals      games    games vs conference rivals      games    game vs interleague conference      games  TOTAL GAMES         All Star Game      First Period  two conferences play each other   Second Period  the other two conferences play each other   Third Period  the winners of the two periods play each other  All star game becomes a mini series between the four conferences  Also gives guys more opportunity to be an all star      Or they can just keep it the way it is with the fantasy draft     Playoff Structure      FIRST ROUND  Divisional Cup Finals   Top two leaders in standings in each division    SECOND ROUND  Conference Cup Finals   The winners of the divisional cup    THIRD ROUND  Stanley Cup Four   The four conference champions  Seeding is determined by season s win loss record    FOURTH ROUND  Stanley Cup Finals    Quick Tidbits      Phoenix is probably going to be moving in the near future but they need to stay in the western conference  Houston would be my first option  it s the  th biggest metropolitan area in the US and it gives Dallas a true rivalry  San Francisco Oakland would be my second option  California will have it s own division if this happens and Las Vegas would be moved to the Rocky Heartland division  Seattle is a distant third option    Yes  Boston and Montreal won t be divisional rivals anymore but they still get to play each other twice a year    The Canadian Conference teams do have to travel a lot more than the other teams but      CANADA HAS IT OWN CONFERENCE ,NHL Realignment Idea,nhl
175,May as well toss out my thoughts and ideas  assuming that NHL goes through with Vegas and Quebec as the new teams   A couple of significant changes from the current structure      Four eight team divisions  but no conferences at all     A playoff featuring the top    teams  bracketed by geography      Northeast   Boston  Quebec  Montreal  Ottawa     East   Toronto  Buffalo  Pittsburgh  Columbus     Metro   NY Rangers  NY Islanders  New Jersey  Philly     Atlantic   Washington  Carolina  Tampa Bay  Florida     Central   Nashville  Dallas  St  Louis  Colorado     Southwest   Arizona  Las Vegas  Los Angeles  Anaheim     Northwest   San Jose  Vancouver  Edmonton  Calgary     North   Winnipeg  Minnesota  Chicago  Detroit    Without conferences  scheduling would be as follows       x against own division     games       x against two  rival  divisions     games       x against all remaining teams     games     The  rival  divisions would be      Northeast   North and East     East   Northeast and Atlantic     Atlantic   East and Central     Central   Atlantic and Southwest     Southwest   Central and Northwest     Northwest   Southwest and North     North   Northwest and Northeast    These rival divisions would play each other three times with the home advantage flip flopping each year  if you look at a map  you can make a rough loop around North America and cycle it clockwise one year and counterclockwise the next to show how the home and away cycle would work    Yes  this does damper the Philly Pittsburgh rivalry a little bit  there just isn t a way to put Philly and Pittsburgh together in a four team division unless neither of them wants to be in the same division with the New York teams and then who would you put for a fourth with the New York teams in that case   and does mean Detroit would face more travel to the west  but in the case of Detroit  it s four additional games in the Mountain and Pacific zones every two years   Without conferences  take the best    records  there would have to be consideration given to whether all eight division winners must qualify  but it would be a rare instance for a division winner to be lower than   th overall    Now  here s how you bracket the playoffs   Split the    teams in half  east and west first   Then split them again   In the West  split the eight teams east and west a second time  creating a Central and a Pacific bracket   In the East  split them north and south instead  creating a Northeast and an Atlantic bracket and then seed by record within those brackets   The playoffs now not only feature the    best teams  but they will be bracketed in a way that they should bring about a lot of the old divisional playoff rivalries once more   Once the regional brackets are played  then you could have a seeded semi final or an East West final  as is done now  to see who will play for the Stanley Cup   The major quibble will likely be with how to handle the New York teams if more than one makes the playoffs like they would have this past year   My preference would be to  unfortunately  stick with geography and split them if necessary   Basically  the Devils would get priority to go to the Atlantic bracket and the Islanders would be prioritized to the Northeast bracket  with the Rangers moving to one or the other   This doesn t preclude the Devils from going to the Northeast should  say  Philly  Columbus  Washington  and Tampa all make the playoffs to form the Atlantic bracket  but generally  I think of New Jersey being closer to Philly and the Islanders being closer to Boston if a split were necessary   Thoughts    Edit   formatting ,A somewhat different realignment idea  complete with a totally new playoffs idea,nhl

99,These ticket  problems   for fucks sake  are for less than     of the seats in the entire arena  I went to plenty of playoff games  there are literally thousands of opposing fans  That    of seats not being sold to Blackhawk fans are nothing  actually  i m pretty sure this isn t the first time in sports history that there has been such a policy  The lady getting kicked out  She was being offensive and taunting the fans surrounding her  which is why she was escorted out  The remarks being made on the front page are extremely salty  and immature  She didn t get kicked out because she was  cheering   None of you probably read the article about the army captain either  because that shit was squashed almost immediately  Sure the lightning aren t an original   team  but they for sure have beaten half of them on their way here  You all need to take a step back and realize that what the lightning are doing is no different from things that happen in other sports  even other teams  And for fucks sake  we re in the top    for attendance  I m not sure you can sit here and compare us to the  Panthers or Hurricanes  its fucking ridiculous ,Let s get something straight here ,nhl

115,My opinion is they have truly one more year at the cup  This offseason Hagelin won t be resigned  but since he s RFA they will get some picks back for him  St  Louis is gone  Boyle is still stuck here   and Talbot will probably get traded  That s my opinion on what will happen  what s yours ,RANGER FANS What steps in the offseason need to be done ,nhl

203,I know the city of Glendale terminated their lease agreement with the Coyotes this week  I also know that Bettman suggested that the NHL and the Coyotes would seek legal action against Glendale  Is that actually going to happen  And will it be resolved by the start of the upcoming season  If not  what s the plan then  Will the NHL temporarily have    teams in the West and    in the East  Will they have Arizona play out of a college arena  I know Arizona is getting a D  NCAA hockey team  until the situation is resolved  And even if they find another arena  how will they generate ticket sales for a team that has already reported a huge financial loss last year  I ve been a fan of the NHL since the late   s and this is the first time I ve seen something like this happen  or at least been old enough to understand what was going on  Does anyone know the general plan  NHL com is all about the Finals right now  which I m fine with  but I m curious for more information on the Coyotes  situation and it s hard to come by,So what s the plan with Arizona ,nhl

235,I want to reflect on my experiences at the      Stanley Cup Finals game tonight     The Tampa Bay Times Forum   Amalie Arena and the Tampa Bay Convention Center are no more than half a mile from one another  And tonight  like many nights they had competing events going on  The Lightning playing the Blackhawks  and METROCON  I didn t know what metrocon was so I had to do some  research    when I came home and found out that is Florida s largest Anime convention  It s been held in Tampa since       and at the Tampa Bay Convention Center since        These coinciding events meant that fans of both Anime and the NHL would be mingling  using the same parking garages  eating at the same places  and seeing one another in the streets  And some of the interactions I saw were disgusting  Some NHL fans were openly  and loudly commenting on how  the freaks  walking around are scaring their children  The parking attendant I paid my money to commented  jesus  look at these freaks  as they exited the garage on foot  And at first  I was with the majority  I stared a little at the odd costumes  large fake weapons  and wanted to comment on how weird it was    But then it hit me  what the fuck do I as a hockey fan have to judge these people with  they re doing the exact same as me  dressing up as people they admire  enjoy and care about  joining together in common meeting places to talk about their shared interests  and attempting to have a good time  Is that any better than the dozen of drunken assholes wearing blue and white sweaters  standing in a parking lot and watching a giant screen of younger than them kids skating on ice    I love the Lightning  and I fucking love hockey  so much so I drove an hour north  paid for parking to stand in a fucking parking lot to watch a bunch of kids play a sporting event in a crowd of similarly dressed and like minded people  But the way that some people were treating the Anime fans was ridiculous and shameful  screaming nasty comments and physically threatening some of them     I just felt that I needed to tell someone about this  and was hoping this would be a good place to explain what I saw  And by no means want this to be me lumping all Lightning  and Blackhawk  fans into one ignorant and hateful group  I have many great experiences as a hockey fan in Tampa  But cannot say tonight was one of my most proud moments  I m guessing that the sheer amount of people around Tampa tonight brought out a lot of the assholes     TL DR  Hockey and Anime fans are one in the same       Go Bolts     ,Stanley Cup Finals Game   vs  Tampa Bay METROCON,nhl

346,For those of you who aren t aware of what the  Larry Bird  Exception is let me first explain  The NBA adopted a rule in which allows teams to exceed the salary cap by means of re signing players of their own  To qualify as one of these qualifying veteran free agents or  Bird free agents  a player must have played three seasons without being waived or changing teams via free agency  These Bird Exception contracts can be up to   years in the NBA and up to a value of a maximum amount as defined by the CBA    The TLDR of this is this salary exception allows teams to exceed the salary cap without penalty in order to retain the players they ve had playing for them    Which is something you sometimes hear complaints about in the NHL  It also avoids teams having to make the Kovalchuk offers that are insanely long in hopes of burring salary in years down the road    With all that in mind  would you be in favor of the NHL adopting a similar exception   I know we are just a few years removed from a lockout that saw us miss half of a season  and the odds of getting something like this added into the CBA right now are small  but just wanted to see what the interest from the fans might look like    Discuss away ,Should The NHL Adopt A  Larry Bird  Salary Cap Exception ,nhl

428, Here    is a complete list of all trades made during this past season  Which do you think was the best trade made   I personally think the Flyers made a great move in dealing Coburn for Gudas  a       st  and a       rd  That team was going nowhere  got a great dman in return   a great pick in a super deep draft   And as a Rangers fan  we got the short end of the stick on the Yandle trade as well  As my name suggests  I would ve much preferred for the Rangers to grab Vermette   ,If You Had To Choose  What Was The Smartest Trade Made During The         Season ,nhl
432,With it being arguably the deepest draft in recent memory  I wanted to watch the full thing in its entirety  Unfortunately  I m gonna be stuck at work on a late project and will miss it  Is there an app that gives you PICK by PICK updates notifications   I know the NHL app is pretty decent  but in recent years it only updates me on the first overall pick and then the teams I have highlighted  you can only highlight five   and ESPN s app gives me updates on what dream Tony Romo had last night instead of the actual hockey updates I have highlighted     any help would be greatly appreciated ,Is there an app for the draft tonight ,nhl

458,I live in Bellingham  WA and I have been pretty interested in the NHL since the playoffs started  I know virtually nothing about hockey and don t know all of the teams  but I want to learn    My frontrunners  Wild  I have been to Minnesota once  and Kings  I was born in LA but moved away when I was    Lightening   Their Logo    is very similar to  my high school s      I don t want to be a Canucks fan because the fans are extremely rude where I live  I live    minutes from the Canadian border and the Canucks fans come to our Costco because it s less expensive  They are horrible drivers and act very rudely in our town  When the Canucks lost in the Stanley Cup Finals a couple of years ago they rioted started fires in Vancouver and damaged parts across the US border  They have left a bad taste in my mouth   I am completely open to following players vs teams until we get a team  Who are the best players in the NHL  Who are the most lovable ,I want to start watching Hockey  I need a team players to follow until Seattle  hopefully  gets an NHL team ,nhl

490,Assuming everything goes well with the expansion process  what do you think the new expansion teams should be named   And yes  you are free to pick any city in USA or Canada  since we really have no idea who all the possible candidates are  but for the sake of keeping it interesting  please try and pick candidates that are rumored about or have a legitimate chance   Me personally  I think the idea of naming a possible Seattle team  Seattle HC   I think it s a very classy name and could go well with the city  Plus it would be fresh and original  in terms of the NHL  not Europe  and lend itself to interesting jersey and logo designs   what about you guys  what do you think ,What would you name the expansion teams ,nhl

494,Points per game vs  Points Earned  Why does the NHL use points earned instead of points per game or percentage to sort the teams   In the NBA or MLB  if team A is       and team B is        team A is listed ahead of team B   But in  the NHL  team B   despite having a worse games above below      and a worse percentage   is listed ahead of team A     Many people claim this is because the NHL has ties  or now overtime losses    But that can t be the reason  as a tie  or now an overtime loss  is precisely equivalent to half a win and half a regulation loss   Furthermore  by using points earned  it effectively makes a regulation loss equivalent to not playing   For example  a        team with    points will still have    points if they lose their next two games and are            ,Why does the NHL use points earned instead of games behind or percentage ,nhl

0,Hello   Its that time of year again  I know that there is not any pending expansion and there most likely will not be for some time  but I am asking what if there was a team coming to Quebec  Las Vegas or Seattle   What I am looking for is a list of players that your team would protect  leave exposed and any trades your franchise would offer to have their players selected or not selected   The Rules are   Teams can protect either   goalie    defense men and   forwards   OR    goalies    defense men and   forwards    If you go the two goalie route  at least one goalie left unprotected must have played in at least    games last season OR    games in the last two seasons combined  One game must be at least    minutes    Each team must leave unprotected at least one defenseman who appeared in    games last season OR    games in the last two seasons combined    Each team must leave unprotected at least two forwards who appeared in    games last season OR    games in the last two seasons combined    Players who have played in    or fewer career games are automatically exempt and do not need to be protected     Somewhat important is that teams can make trades with the expansion team as incentive for them to select or not select a certain player   San Jose did this in the last expansion draft with Evgeni Nabkov      If you think your team would like to offer such a trade just include it in your post   Also  Please list the players exposed in your post  as this will make it easier to sort out the available players later    Free agents are not eligible for protection or selection    Also  upon research in past years expansion teams have not been able to select first overall in the draft  and are granted the forth overall selection   I know that this has come up recently but I feel this is somewhat different as it is coming after the season   It would be fun to get every team listed and do a mock expansion draft    Have fun  ,Mock expansion draft scenario,nhl

68,Yeah so I feel  a little guilty   Been an Oilers fan since they came into the league so have been going through a bad spell these past    years    I always knew Ovechkin was a good player but that there might have been some side issues of him committing to the team game    That he was a challenge to coaches   Watching the NYR   Caps  series has really tuned me into his game   his current game   I never realized how much hitting is part of his game and I fucking love it   This guy is a beast   He is having the best year  my opinion  that I have seen since coming into the league   Anyway   that dude has skill and grit and i have under rated his played   not any more   Great player ,Ovechkin  I have underrated him for too long,nhl

78,I know a ton of people prematurely picked them to beat the hawks  and they ended up getting swept  but it was an excellent series  Wild fans have a lot to be excited about in the future   They remind me a lot of my hawks from around            right before they put it all together   A few pieces are missing   a little depth  and you guys are stacked  Dont feel bad about losing  The Hawks are just too deep  and have too much experience   and even with those advantages    of the games still could of went either way  The wild hung with one of the best teams of the past decade  and although the series final doesn t show it  it was a close  well fought series  The hawks have major cap issues next year  as do the blues  I can see Minnesota filling that void soon if they can keep the pieces in place and add a bit  Great series guys  ,Wild are close  Great series,nhl
80,I work with Cam Connor and have been trying to find the video of his double OT goal against the Leafs in the quarter finals in       Understandably  I m having little luck  If there are any hockey scholars out there  do you happen to have footage of the shot or game   April   th        Montreal vs  Toronto   Edit   I added  Don t upvote   because as far as I understand Reddit  it s the fastest way to get things recognized  Just tell Reddit not to do something and they ll do the opposite out of spite ,An odd request  Don t upvote ,nhl

108,   The goalie was out of the crease      Ward was pushed into the goalie  It was a good goal  I ve seen this type of goal scored      times in the same manner and not once was goalie interference called  I don t think it s a coincidence that teams from New York  LA  and Chicago always go far in the playoffs every year  I m starting to lose interest because it feels like it s rigged,Ward goal was a good goal  NHL is rigged,nhl

168,What are some rules you would take out of the game  Maybe change just a little bit   For me  I d get rid of the trapezoid now that we have hybrid icing  The trapezoid was dumb to begin with IMO because it led to some players racing down for a non icing puck when the goalie could just play it and avoid any unnecessary dangerous collisions  Now that there s hybrid icing and no more racing to touch the puck  the trapezoid just seems useless  especially when you see a goalie get penalized when he s trying settle the puck down and his stick touches it an inch in the restricted area  I ve seen that burn teams a number of times and it just seems ridiculous   Just my thoughts  Feel free to disagree ,Any rules that could be changed ,nhl

197,So with the talk of expansion and places like Las Vegas and Seattle coming up  why has Houston not come up  We supported the AHL s aeros fairly well  would have a natural rivalry with Dallas  are financially stable because of the oil industry  have a rising Canadian population  an NHL ready stadium in the Toyota Center and the fourth largest population in the United States  Even if it is not an expansion team  the Florida Panthers are floundering in the standings and from my understanding nearly bankrupt  they could be relocated to H Town  ,Houston,nhl

238,First of all  on my television  the score bar at the top is way off center  One of the team s score is invisible  They don t get the whole offensive zone in the camera  and you often can t see the defenseman receive the puck when a low to high pass to the point is made   Then there s the broadcasting decisions  After today s Game    they went to a commercial break almost immediately after time expired  That s just unacceptable  Every other broadcast I ve ever seen on any other channel will show the players congratulating the goalie  etc  There s just no excuse for that  ever   Additionally  replays are shown so soon after a goal is scored  with the sound getting messed up   quieted  that one cannot easily see the crowd s reaction  This even happens on NBCSN   Anyone else frustrating by these  and similar  issues ,NBC National Broadcasts have problems    ,nhl

408,So    there is nothing more cheesy then watching the visiting team win the Stanley Cup  A whole     fans are cheering  and the rest are bummed out beyond belief    I think the Stanley Cup should be held in a neutral city which gets announced at the start of the playoffs  All teams who didn t make the playoffs have an equal chance to host the Stanley Cup finals in their city   For this to work properly  all season passes for these games at that stadium need to be NULL and VOID  This will give an equal chance to fans of both teams  just like Superbowl  for example  to purchase tickets and cheer for their team   I think this would create a much more exciting environment for the finals and create a much more entertaining finish no matter who wins the cup at the end  Celebrations would be equally as epic  even if it is the  visiting  team who is winning    Thoughts  ,The Stanley Cup Finals should take place in a neutral city ,nhl

1,I m somewhat new to hockey  I became a leafs fan         so I watched some playoffs from that time till now  I got a question why do teams like the Ducks Sharks Canadeins Caps Pens and Blues always choke  I can understand on why Montreal always chokes cause they rely to much on goaltending to stand on their head every night and they ll probably be a    nd round exist  Cause the team is nothing with out price  But what about the Ducks Sharks and Blues  They do so well in the season yet they choke  Anyone have an explanation  ,What is the reason on why teams choke in the playoffs ,nhl

39,In the Flames Oilers game from last night             Jonas Hiller came into the game in relief of Karri Ramo at approximately the one minute mark of the game  Ramo was not credited with any saves in that minute or so  Hiller made    saves over the rest of the game and earned a     win for his team  He will not be credited with an individual shutout  although his team will have earned one in the records   Anybody else find that to be bogus  I could almost see the logic in not awarding an individual shutout if two goalies had to make some number of saves  and they don t want to award fractional shutouts  But if one goalie makes no saves  then really no goaltending was shared  all the goaltending was done by the other guy  I know that s not true in some ways  but certainly one of the goalies was not required to stop the puck   I dunno  this bugs me  Especially because this will probably be instrumental in my fantasy hockey championship matchup  Thanks for letting me vent   Definition of shutout from  Wikipedia      In the event a shutout happens while using several goaltenders  the shutout will be credited to the team who shut out the opponent  however  no single goaltender will be awarded the shutout ,No shutout for Hiller in Flames v Oilers,nhl

125,I m an NHL newbie  but it seems to me that the Sens are already in the playoffs   Even if the Sens lose and Boston and Pittsburgh both win  the Sens would be tied for points with the Bruins   So the next tie breaker is the points for against Sens Bruins  By my count  they re tied           Sat    Nov       Senators  Bruins      PM  FINAL OTT       BOS       Sat     Dec       Senators  Bruins       PM  FINAL OTT       BOS     SO    Sat    Jan       Senators  Bruins       PM  FINAL OTT       BOS     OT    Tue     Mar       Bruins  Senators      PM  FINAL BOS       OTT       Thu     Mar       Bruins  Senators      PM  FINAL BOS       OTT      I m not even sure if it goes further  since Boston has   home games and the Sens only have    so the first Boston home game is eliminated  meaning the Sens lead in goals         Regardless  the final tie breaker is GF GA average  Right now the Sens are at      and the Bruins are at      So for the Bruins to bump the Sens  doesn t that mean that not only do the Sens need to lose  but they need to lose by like    goals  and not only do the Bruins need to win  but they need to win by like    goals   So it s mathematically impossible for the Sens not to make the playoffs ,Have the Senators not already clinched a playoff spot ,nhl

180,A lot of people are really counting the Pens out of this one early   Much of that is because of the way in which they ve performed the past two weeks or so   Needless to say  with Crosby and Malkin healthy  this team could do anything   I watched both teams on film a bit  looked at some numbers  and noticed a few things       The Rangers  as a whole  have a lot more depth  but this could go unsaid         Lundqvist struggled to stay healthy but still managed to put up    wins along with a      save percentage and   shutouts   His backup  Cam Talbot actually posted better numbers in his    starts with a      save percentage  and   shutouts as well       The Rangers team had    shutouts among three goalies   Marc Andre Fleury had    shutouts himself  considered by some to be team MVP this year      As said  the Rangers do have a lot of depth  but they re scoring is somewhat unbalanced   Rick Nash leads the team with    goals  which is    greater than the second highest scorer    tied with       Shutting down Nash could be the key to stopping the Rangers attack   The Penguins have three players with     goals  Crosby     Malkin     Hornqvist       Malkin and Hornqvist both missed time due to injuries   Having them healthy again could be dangerous        Don t sleep on Martin St  Louis   He s a proven playoff performer with    goals and    points in    games   A lower body injury sustained in March slowed him down a bit  but that shouldn t have much effect on him at this point         Not having Letang could result in a nightmare for the Penguins   Just look at how they have played without him thus far   A lot of people consider this the primary reason why the Penguins will struggle to pull off an upset        Watch out for Chris Kreider to emerge as a top player in this series   He s coming off of his first full season  and has already scored    goals in    playoff games at the age of      Last year  he had   in the Rangers cup run     I think the winner of this series will take it in   games   By the end of game three  I think the momentum will tell us a lot about which way this one goes ,Rangers vs  Penguins   Recipe for disaster  or an upset ,nhl

447,the sabers had the best chance to win the draft yet they lost to the third best worst team  how is it decided the order of the picks  is it just ping pong balls and what ever order they are picked is the order of the draft  what i mean is do they put the top    teams in and pick them out and that is the order of the draft  yes i know they might not use ping pong balls but i just worded it this way to help me understand how this works  ,how does the draft lottery work ,nhl
454,Im not saying that the NHL chose the overall and didn t actually leave it to chance  but I d be much less skeptical if they did a ball machine like they do for the normal lottery  ,Anyone else find the physical lottery system sketchy ,nhl
455,How does your team or your fans stand behind it being a good place for McDavid to go considering the abysmal track record the oilers have with turning prospects into shit players  ,Edmonton Oilers Fans    Change my View  This is the worst thing to happen to McDavid s career,nhl
457,I m not a huge sports fan  but I do enjoy the NFL  I ve always respected hockey as a sport  but growing up in Kentucky  was never really exposed to it much  It seems like a sport I could really get into  but I don t know too much about it  Give me a crash course in hockey rules and history ,Help me become a fanatic ,nhl
458,I m not trying to beat a dead horse  We know this was the worst case scenario  We know no one  except Edmonton  is happy about it    What I want to know is    why make what should be a huge television event one of the most boring and anticlimactic events ever broadcast  I mean  they weren t even organized about HOW they were announcing it  kept flip flopping between pulling the card or the announcer just giving it away   If they wanted transparency  why not pull lotto balls  Have a computer with all the combinations and have it eliminate teams from the board as their numbers are no longer possible  More exciting  more transparent  better tv  Instead we got these weird giant envelopes and no transparency whatsoever  I m seriously looking for a logistical explanation  Why wouldn t they do it any other way ,Why couldn t they have just broadcasted the lottery balls being pulled ,nhl
459,What I ve found so far are individual teams  calendars  I want it all  Thank you,Anyone know of a Google calendar of the NHL playoffs  All teams ,nhl
460,Two games in the Senators are being outshot by a team with better goaltending  You don t need to look at advanced stats to know that s a bad sign  I know the games have been tight  but it seems like the Habs are controlling play much better  and it s only a matter of time before they start winning with a bigger margin  I think the Sens need to start stirring the pot a little more  A few fights and big hits could send the game into chaos  which generally takes goaltending out of the equation  or at least minimizes the impact  I know it s been chaotic already  but it s stayed surprisingly tame on the ice  barring a few moments  despite that  They have a considerable size advantage over the Habs  I think we ll see some punches thrown if they get off to a bad start tonight   Really  what else could they do aside from  put more pucks on net   or  give up fewer chances up close  to make this a winnable series ,Are the Senators not being physical  enough  ,nhl
461,How does being drafted actually work  I m thinking of Dylan Larkin who was drafted   th last year  but is currently playing for Michigan  Does this just mean that the Red Wing s have him when he leaves school  And why do it this way rather than similar to football and basketball where they re drafted after they declare ,ELI  Draft  not lottery ,nhl
462,I get that the team in last has the higher odds at     to win it and that it s a weighted ball system  like state lotteries and the power megaball   What I don t get is how it determines the position the team gets in the draft   Are all teams given a set of numbers  so Buffalo would be given more and Boston given less  and the number one spot is the only drawing  So out of the   numbers drawn the team with the matching set is the winner  ,ELI  the draft lottery ,nhl
464,The oilers have won the first overall pick for the  th time in   years   Anyone else pissed   The nhl draft lottery is a joke ,Oilers win lottery  right to draft Connor mcdavid,nhl
466,So the odds of them getting  at least    of the last      picks are        or   in     Very slim  but not as ridiculous as you might think  mostly due to the rules in      and       where only the bottom   teams could supplant them  so they had a       chance of hanging on to it   Then consider that by taking the past   years alone  you re stacking the numbers in the worst possible way against the Oilers  since starting to count when their luck begins artificially inflates the improbability  yes  I also get frustrated when commentators compare the past    games  of one team with the past    games  of another just to pull the stats they want    So  it was feasible  Maddening and excruciating  but feasible that this would happen  So if the fact that Edmonton s previous wins were in some of the least talented draft classes wasn t enough to convince you it s not a conspiracy  hopefully the odds will convince you  We ll see far more improbable things in the season to come    Basically  the odds of them getting at least      s are      minus the odds of getting just    just    and just      picks  Here s a link to a google doc where I calculated it  Took about an hour    ,I calculated the odds for the Oilers to get the    pick at least   of the last   years  Honestly not as shocking as I was expecting ,nhl
467,The golf courses are looking pretty nice nowadays with all the snow gone  enjoy     Yours truly  Canadians Canadiens fan ,Have fun Senators,nhl
468,Is that normal every time the Habs play the senators or was there something earlier in the game  I tuned in after game of thrones was over so I joined the game late  ,Why was pk Suban getting booed so hard by senators fans tonight ,nhl
472,Cameron Diaz   Really  How do you still have a job  ,Really Glenn Healy ,nhl

482,Buffalo s  nd overall pick  Ristolainen  Zadorov  and Reinhart ,What is a monumental trade for McDavid ,nhl
483,Hi  I m SeniorSophomore  I m new to Reddit and I love hockey  I ve been watching for about two years now  with a limited knowledge on how the game works  after taking a long break from watching hockey which was for about three years or so  I ve been trying to become reacquainted and learn some things in the hockey world   How should you handle the depth on a roster along with how you should handle the salary cap correctly  what makes a top team in the NHL  etc   But I ve been seeing people talking about corsi and I have no clue what that is  Can someone explain it to me  I ve heard people talk about corsi when it comes to certain players and teams actually playing instead of just shots and things like that  but again  I have no clue what any of it means  So if someone can please explain it to me  that would be great  There s more things that I have do questions on but I ll stick to this one for now  ,Corsi  Who s she   See what I did there  ,nhl
492,Edmonton won the McDavid sweepstakes  much to the dismay of my Sabres  But there s been a collective sadness on behalf of McDavid  because Edmonton has been the place for future stars to go die  They should honestly be such a stacked team loaded with stars at this point  it s unbelievable that they still end up towards the bottom every year   Their drafting spots have been unprecedented  with now their  th    pick in   years  That s insane  To see how crazy this sort of thing is  I wanted to see what Edmonton s record would look like if they picked the players that the teams drafting in the same spots in the other major sports  NFL  MLB  and NBA  picked   In the last ten years the Oilers have picked           th           th  traded   th           th           th           th          st          st          st          th          rd          st    So if they were a team in the other major sports  here s what the last    years of Oilers players would look like    Year   Draft Position   NFL   Position   MLB   Position   NBA   Position                                                                                                      Jason Campbell QB Matt Garza RHP Rashad McCants SG            LenDale White RB Jason Taylor SS Louis Williams PG            LaRon Landry S Ross Detwiler LHP Yi Jianlian PF             Chris Williams OT Aaron Hicks OF Joe Alexander SF            Michael Crabtree WR Drew Soren RHP Brandon Jennings PG           Sam Bradford QB Bryce Harper OF John Wall PG            Cam Newton QB Gerrit Cole RHP Kyrie Irving PG            Andrew Luck QB Carlos Correa SS Anthony Davis PF           Johnathan Cooper G Hunter Dozier SS Ben McLemore SG           Blake Bortles QB Carlos Rodon LHP Andrew Wiggins SG            Jameis Winston  QB Brendan Rodgers  SS Karl Anthony Towns  C     Now  with those kinds of players     do you really think they d still be anywhere near the bottom  or are the Oilers just really that bad    Sorry  Oilers fans  I m just a little bitter ,Putting Edmonton s drafts in context with the other major sports leagues,nhl

348,First and foremost  I understand that logos change over the years and many teams have multiple logos   We will be looking only at the primary logos for the           season as they appear on the NHL website   Here s a link with all of them     Here s my proposed process  Each respondent will rank each logo from best to worst by division  so each person will generate four lists   Teams will get one point for best logo in the division  two points for second best  etc   The two teams in each division with the best average score will advance to our final round   We ll repeat the process with those top eight teams in the finals   If people want to go further and get an even more detailed list  we can divide the remaining    teams into divisions as well and repeat the process  ex  ranking logos      and logos       in their own separate consolation rounds    If you wish to be a part of the process  please provide your four divisional rankings below so we can get started   A simple numbered list is sufficient  with   being the best in your opinion and   or    depending on division  as the worst   Eastern Conference teams ranked as eighth in their respective divisions will also receive seven points so they don t get screwed simply for being in a larger division   I will show my list as an example and to get things started   Here are some guidelines for anyone who is interested   These lists are subjective and different people will have different criteria for what constitutes a  good  logo   Some may prefer classic looks  some may prefer new school   Some may like simplicity  some may like intricacy   That s the whole point   You create your own criteria for what a  good  logo is   When stuck between two teams consider this  if you were on a hockey team  which logo would you rather have on your jersey   TRY TO KEEP FAN BIASES OUT OF THIS   I know this is easier said than done  but try to eliminate as much of that bias as you can   This is meant to find reddit s favorite LOGO  not favorite TEAM   Similarly  don t judge a logo by who wears it   Don t dock the Penguins because you think Crosby is a whiner and don t boost the Canadiens because Manny Malhotra is the best name in the league   I d obviously like to get as many respondents as possible because I d like the list to be as accurate as possible   It also gives me an excuse to mess around with spreadsheets   Thank you and happy ranking ,There are many lists out there tanking NHL logos from worst to best  There s a lot on which they disagree  Care to help me determine which logos reddit thinks are the best ,nhl

270,Browsing through  Puckalytics    goalie stats recently  I ve started to become really interested in performance of goalies in different situations  In particular  I was interested in seeing how performance changed from  close situations   which Puckalytics defines as a   goal difference in the first and second periods and or a tie in the third  to situations where one team had a big lead or deficit  By determining the differences between the   stats  we could paint a rough picture of which goalies play better when the pressure is on vs off  as well as gain insights into pretty specific situations   First as a baseline  lets look at save percentages in  v  close situations  We use close situations as the baseline primarily because each team should be playing a relatively balanced play style  I e   when you have a big lead your team will probably play a more defensive style  which you would normally expect to lead to a higher save    Likewise  when you are losing your team may be more aggressive  which can lead to more breakaways and rebounds and an overall lower save   for the goalie    on   close helps to mitigate the differences in strategy for those situations   For the data set  goalies had to have a minimum of     minutes ice time where they played in close situations     Looking at the baseline graph  we don t see many surprises     Perhaps the biggest surprise is that Carey Price isn t in the top    but we can attribute this to the fact that he is stupidly consistent in pretty much all situations  i e  top   in winning losing situations  decent PP save  etc   Pekka and Craig Anderson on the other hand  seem to be especially good at full strength and when the game is on the line  Of course some of this can be attributed to the way defenses play and their overall talent level as well  but this still paints a pretty good picture   Now on to the really interesting part  imo   How does their close game play compare to their play when the game is starting to get out of reach  To visualize this  I collected data for save   in losing and winning situations when the margin was   goals or more  then I subtracted the close game save   from those results  Then I plotted the differences as x y coordinates on a plane    Let s look at Pekka for example  For the Y coordinate point I take         Losing by    subtract         close game  and get         so Pekka is nearly   percent worse when the Predators are losing and playing aggressive than when the game is close   Then for the X coordinate I plot the difference between winning by   save   and close save    which is         so Pekka s plot on the graph becomes                   CLICK HERE FOR RESULTS       So what does it all mean     Well  we can loosely infer a few things from this  I wouldn t go so far as making snap judgments about every player based on it  but I do still think a lot of it is interesting  Let s run through the quadrants         The expected    With the exception of outliers like Lundqvist and Miller  this is what you would expect to see given the situation  As we noted earlier team with the lead  should  lead to a better   for the goalie  while a team trailing will usually lead to a worse         Miller and Lundqvist are interesting  Do they get frustrated because they keep letting shots through  making them play worse  Do their teams get too aggressive offensively leading to breakaways  A combination of both  I don t watch the Canucks or Rangers enough to comment but would be interested to hear opinions       The not so clutch    These goalies seem to play consistently better when the game is out of reach in one way or another  Is it because they tense up under pressure when the game is close and don t play as well  Or  with players who have a high save   when losing  is it because they try and put the game on their shoulders and save the team       The sloppy    These goalies tend to have a the best save percentage only when the game is on the line  Honestly  for most of them I wouldn t make too big of a deal about it  because most of them are not that much worse when winning and know to step up in the right situation       Jake Allen  however is getting pretty dangerously sloppy  Admittedly it s a lower sample size  just about    shots on goal  because the Blues aren t frequently winning by    when he s on the ice  but it s still enough of a trend that if I were his coach I would definitely point it out to him  He s letting about   in every   shots through in   on   hockey when the Blues are winning by     and that s just nuts considering they should be playing more aggressive defensively in that situation       The weird    These goalies perform better when losing and worse when winning and I don t know what to make of it  Lehtonen is not a big difference  probably just facing aggressive offenses when his team is winning and stepping up when the game is close  Niemi  however seems to really lose interest if his team is winning big  and genuinely starts focusing when his team is losing by     Either that  or San Jose s game plan is just really out of whack  attacking more when winning big  playing more defensively when losing big    Would be really interested in hearing s thoughts on all this  Let me know if you have any questions or see anything flawed with my methodology  ,Is your goalie better when the pressure is on  or off  Are they sloppy when they have the lead  A look at the differences in   on   save   in different situations   xpost ,nhl

110,It boggles my mind that a professional organization can be so inconsistent in the way it officiates the game  Three major examples     After play is whistled dead in front of a goalie s net there is immediate pushing  face washing  crosschecks  etc  If a call is made  it is usually the player who retaliates  in fact  this notion is constantly echoed by announcers   All this does is increase player tension and slow the game  If they really wanted to address fighting without eliminating it  this would be a good start     There is a different standard depending on circumstances  Calls are less likely during penalty kills  end of the game  overtime  and playoffs      Why is blood a determining factor in whether high sticking penalties are minors or double minors  Getting hit in the face head sucks regardless of whether you get cut  I can t think of other sports that use this as factor  Usually it has to do with the nature of the penalty and intent ,Hockey has the most inconsistent enforcement of rules,nhl
115,I wonder who  if anyone would excel at one of these positions  I gotta think Ron Hextall would have been a tough winger or defenseman to play against  Or imagine someone like Ben Bishop clogging up the front of the opponents net on a power play   Anyway  just curious what comes to mind for you guys  Cheers ,Which NHL goalie do you think would be the best forward or defenseman ,nhl
121,I know a lot of people like their announcers and would not bad mouth them  This being said however I d like you to express your feeling and opinions on certain announcers you find dirty    Allow me to explain  I am a ducks fan and I will say Brian Hayward and John Ahlers don t play favorites  They do call bs on the ducks and don t try to idolize their fuck ups  Dirty are announcers that like to push the idea that their team is flawless even when they play dirty and when bs calls are made for their team they actively cheer    John Ahlers always makes a point of saying things along the lines of  That s just how it is going to be   They call referee bullshit even when it benefits the club  That being said some announcers tend to praise the terrible calls as good calls    So give me your opinions on these announcers either their faults or great work  It s hard to experience all of the announcers because we all have our own teams so try to see the bull they spew sometimes  ,Honest announcers and those who aren t ,nhl

200,I m a Lightning fan  Being born in New York made some room for the Rangers too  but my real allegiance lies with the Bolts  I m just curious here  Whoever you are  are you biased against the NHL in the South  I assure you  we can fill up the arena here in Tampa any given night  It s a hockey city now  I would know  I go to about half of the home games  The atmosphere s pretty electric  pun intended   Now that we re good again  does anyone still have contempt or bias toward the Lightning and hockey in warmer areas ,What do you think of hockey in places such as Tampa Bay ,nhl

206,I m not a Ranger fan by any means  but anyone else extremely surprised Lundqvist didn t make the ASG even with injuries to Howard and Rinne   His numbers are pretty average but when I think of the best goalies in the league  he s honestly the first one I think of ,Lundqvist snub,nhl

217,Trading Dubnyk recently made me think about the potential reasons and I could only think of a couple  Maybe it was to free up some salary so they can make a real offer to someone and boost their offense  Maybe it was to boost Mike Smith s confidence as he will once again be the main goaltender  He apparently was ecstatic about the trade  as shitty as that sounds  Or maybe they knew nobody would want Mike Smith in his current condition so they tried to get something for someone before the draft   The Coyotes constantly try to pull people up from the minors in hopes that they will be a star  At this point it s like watching someone with a gambling addiction continuously fail   They have positioned themselves somewhat decently this year for the draft at least    So all jokes aside what would you try in order to salvage what is left of the Coyotes ,How would you turn the Arizona Coyotes franchise around ,nhl
225,Does anyone else have this issue   Sometimes I try to watch a game shortly after it finishes on my Apple TV  using NHL Game Center   NHL Center Ice  I paid the annual subscription    But it always says that the game isn t ready yet to watch   usually it takes about   hours for the game to be available    The actual message is  Please wait for the replay    This game has ended   An archived version will be available soon    Funny thing is  if I turn the game on while the game is still live  I can rewind to the beginning and watch the whole thing   But as soon as the game is over  I can t access the game until several hours later   Also interesting  this problem does not show up when watching the game on my computer   Just wondering if anyone else has experienced the same problem and or if someone knows a fix   Thanks,Use your Apple TV to watch NHL games  Games not available until about   hours after they finish ,nhl
231,Nothing against the idea of playing for a conference championship but hear me out   Players don t play or compete for the conference championship  well they do but it s not the goal   You see it when most teams don t even touch and look at the trophy  It s just another stepping stone closer to the final  So wouldn t a final   seated bracket work  The remaining two teams from each conference are ranked based on regular season standings and they flip conferences   st east plays  nd west   st west plays  nd east  How many times have you watched a conference final and thought that the two teams playing were the best   in the NHL and they should rightfully so play for the championship  I know that it s only mid way through this current season and I shouldn t even be thinking about playoffs or bothering with these pipedreams    But as a leaf fan day dreaming about the playoffs is usually all I get to do ,Would anyone else side with no conference final series  if it meant the best two teams played for Stanley ,nhl

381,The NHL All Star Game is a complete joke  It reminds me of Pee Wee  No Contact  hockey and is essentially a glorified shootout  I wanted to watch a hockey game and instead watched an endless goal celebration    I think we need to make an incentive for the players to want to play a good  hard fought game  This means teams are divided by conference and the winning conference gets home ice in the Stanley Cup Finals    Before everyone jumps on the downvote bandwagon this system works for MLB  Where the MLB All Star Game decides home field advantage in the world series  They consistently have a great game that is as much fun as it is a demonstration of skill  ,How do we make the NHL All Star Game into a Serious Game ,nhl

459,Before we start I would like to first say this is not a theory I believe  but also not outside the realm of possibility either   Just something I thought deserves more discussion than  the NHL hates my Canadian team and loves your American team  accusations commonly littered over sports news websites              So here is my take on this theory   based solely on the complaints I ve heard both on the net and Irl   The majority of American hockey fans  despite having a storied history with the game are quite fickle  So in order to keep the game profitable in its biggest markets the league  favours  those markets subtlety in the games gray areas such as reffing and hearings and whatever other areas thing might go unnoticed   From where Bettmen and the owners sit  this actually makes a lot of sense   Revenue sharing should keep most other teams out of the red   as long as they are dominating their largest markets           On another note   it is a possibility that the NHL is not favouring certain teams   but is showing bias against certain teams because the market permits it   Most Canadian markets are like a magic never ending river of cash  Edmonton and Toronto of course are huge examples of how a business could model around delivering a unsatisfactory product for years and still remain profitable   If the NHL were intentionally sabotaging Canadian teams   from a financial standpoint it hardly matter to them in the slightest   especially in contrast to the financial issues facing teams like Arizona and Florida           The last argument I ll present for this theory is Gary man with a plan Bettmem   He is the one reason this doesn t seems as far fetched as perhaps it should   His reputation is of one who is willing to sacrifice the integrity of the sport for a increase in profit   If we were to look at the history of his tenure   I m sure we would find a ton of evidence to support this   but I m going to focus on a more current topic   The World Cup of hockey              The  world cup   of hockey is actually a concept I support  It s announced format is nothing more than a shortsighted business tactic designed to put pressure on the Olympics  If the NHL prioritized the growth of the sport   and quality competition it would have instead come out and announced a qualifying tournament to take place at some point in the next few years   Instead we get teams being thrown together to best make use of NHL assets so the tournament can be held locally  on the cheap    The NHL has stated it plans on transforming this into a dignified event with qualifiers for other countries and all but as we all know   they must host this half baked tournament ASAP so they can gain leverage in the argument to keep NHL players out of the  Koran Winter Olympics   So yes  again  the business over integrity model definitely fits with the theory above and could be a factor in swaying some opinions toward that line of thinking              The only big implausibility I can see is the NHL s history of leaked informatiom  Some of these incidents are intentional and calculated   other times something may just happen to slip through the cracks   A conspiracy of this scale would likely require cooperation from more than a few individuals  Refs  owners and people in the department of player safety immediately come to mind   If any one individual were to disagree with this approach  like say the owner of a struggling Canadian franchise  it would be as simple as an anonymous leak to the media    Or Bob Mackenzie to cause a huge stir  The rate at watch information is leaked in the NHL it would be extremely shocking to find out something like this has been going on under our noses              Would Bettmen and Co really take this kind of risk  My gut is leaning toward no   but like I said it s not impossible   The argument though is deffs a bit Shaky  Unless something comes to light in the future all we can do is keep guessing   ,The Southern Conspiracy,nhl

323,yes this is super tedious  but I m scoring for my local team and I want to understand shots on goal       Two scenarios  a  Offence shoots on net  defender deflects and it goes in  b  Defender has control of the puck and it goes in his own net  Scenario a  I think is straight forward  shooter gets the shot and the goal  because the deflection is a failed block  b  confuses me  Most recent opponent to touch gets credit for the goal  But what about the shot  Is it actually possible for a team to be up     without registering a shot on goal  If a shot is registered  does it also go to the most recent opponent to touch the puck ,Shot on Goal stat for own goals ,nhl

257,So this is my first time ever living in a city that does not have a hockey team and it is miserable  I live in Kansas City  and am stoked to be going to the Blues game here tomorrow  and the talk of an expansion get me excited about a team coming here  Of course  this will just end in disappointment but here are my completely biased thoughts of some of the cities that are being discussed for an expansion  Was wondering what everyone else thought   Seattle   Don t know much about the hockey scene there but couldn t imagine it being too great and any hockey fans there now I would assume have adopted Vancouver as their team  Although I guess Vancouver is a great team to jump ship from but don t see it being a big hockey market   Toronto Part II   Hockey is HUGE is Toronto  which is why everyone is already a die hard Leafs fan  Anyone in Toronto who is not a Leafs fan I would assume has latched on to another team already making a new team in Toronto tough to have a fan base   Las Vegas   Huge gimmick  Already know their name would be the Gamblers or something along those lines  They may do well financially but won t have much of a solid fan base  I accredit that to the population in LV being a good amount of tourist who will just go to a game  or not  when they are there  If only there was another team in that area that we could compare them to in order to see how they would fare   see  Phoenix  Quebec City   crapshoot  could go either way  They have lost a team before but a comparison to Winnipeg could be appropriate and Winnipeg  as I understand  is doing ok for themselves so far   Kansas City   BOOM  May say that the midwest is not good for hockey and there is no fan base but look in comparison to other similar nearby cities  STL  COL  DAL  who all have a strong fan base  The people in KC could latch on to a team to make their own  The team may initially not fare all that well but will be a huge boost to the sport as it would create an entirely new fan base which will help spread and grow the game  An immediate rivalry will also be born with STL  Just my rant for the day was wondering what others thought ,NHL Expansion,nhl

43,I m not certain when all the hate for the automatic penalty for breaking an opponent s stick started   I ve even heard commentators that I normally have a degree of respect for  yes  I m looking at you  HNIC  go off against this automatic penalty   Two points on this   From the rulebook        Slashing   Slashing is the act of a player swinging his stick at an opponent  whether contact is made or not  Non aggressive stick contact to the pant or front of the shin pads  should not be penalized as slashing    B Any forceful or powerful chop with the stick on an opponent s body  the opponent s stick  or on or near the opponent s hands that  in the judgment of the Referee  is not an attempt to play the puck  shall be penalized  B  as slashing    Bold added by me   Those folks who claim it to be an automatic penalty should read the f ing rule they bitch about   It s not automatic        in the judgment of the Referee       The other point I would like to raise   are they seriously saying that players should be allowed to intentionally break an opponents stick   If this is indeed the case  have they considered the ramifications   Stick makers would be quite happy  I m certain ,Slashing the stick bandwagon,nhl

212,This is the first time  in a long time  I m totally pleased with all of the selections    For as long as I ve really cared who got in on any particular season  and that s quite a few years   there isn t a name on the list I m not thinking      I d have chosen this guy over that    The Dominator    Harts as a goalie  the stats  the way he impacted how kids wanted to play the position  the sheer dominance at times   many times  Crazy   Modano  All he did was score  One of the best sets of hands ever  So  so fast and smooth sailing in with the puck  Top of the list for US born players but  that statements overshadows him being just one of the best ever    Blake  Sure  there s some heat coming from people regarding the big trade but bitterness can never erase what he did on the ice  A big guy who played bigger  Intelligent  Down right nasty when he had to be  Any kid with aspirations of being a great D man should dive into video of this beaut     Forsberg  What s to say  Without him the Avs don t have their Cups  A guy everyone loved to watch play even if he was playing against your team  Just plain fun to watch with a highlight reel days long  Such a shame the style of play he chose and  that got so many of us to be fans of his ultimately shut him down too early   McCreary  If only we had more guys like him wearing the red band  Respected by players  coaches  and fans alike  If he was on your game you knew if he didn t make a call it was because he just couldn t see it  Clone the man   Mr  Pat Burns  Huge to me personally as a Leafs fan  I still strongly believe this should have been done while he was still with us but  finally  we get to see his likeness added to the Wall  Nobody can dispute his worthiness of being a HhoF member  Just a great coach  plain and simple   Since his passing I ve quietly cursed out the committee for denying him accepting the honor in person  Tonight I m happy  Mainly because of how his widow  Lynn  was told of the honor by Quinn and Davidson  Choosing to call her rather than letting her just hear it through the media was a great gesture by two classy gents  The emotion in her voice will resonate with me for a while    Thanks Pat  Congrats ,This years HhoF selections,nhl
236,I feel like Suter really deserved to be nominated  he s played his ass off for two years with the Wild  and finished the regular season at      which is amazing when you consider the fact that he averaged       per game  He also had more blocked shots than Kieth and Chara  falling about    behind Weber   I even loved Suter when he played for Nashville  I m not just saying this as a Wild fan ,Was anybody else bothered by the fact that Suter wasn t even nominated for the Norris trophy last night ,nhl

277,Back in good old       my Dad  just a young tyke  was at Game   of the Stanley Cup Playoffs between the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Montreal Canadiens  Unfortunately for him  he had an appendix attack and had to go to the emergency hospital in the arena   While he was down there  a Toronto player  I can t remember who  was there with an injury  This nice player  whoever it was  took pity on my Dad and ended up getting a stick signed by the team  I don t know      if it was the whole team or a majority of the players  but there s a good amount of signatures on it  I don t know for sure if it was the game winning stick  I don t think it was   but I don t think that changes the importance too much  Some of the signatures are a tad faded due to the fact that it s been a long time since they ve won     My Dad ended up passing away a few years ago and my brother and I inherited the stick  We re not exactly in the process of selling it  but that doesn t stop our curiosity for wondering how much it might be worth  If I had to guess  I would also assume that as long as the Leafs keep losing for another   years at least  the value would go up   For the   th anniversary of the last time they won   Any help input would be greatly appreciated   ,Hypothetically  what would this signed stick be worth   Story inside  ,nhl

15,If you won t talk about it  I will   Montreal outplayed Boston  I d be severely disappointed with that game if I were a Habs fan  It seemed like every time the puck left a Bruin s stick  it ended up in Montreal s possession  And then those breakaways     Anyways  looking forward to the next game ,Shutout in Montreal  and a frozen yogurt eating game winner ,nhl

98,Las Vegas frequently gets mentioned as a site for an expansion team and I think it makes a lot of sense actually  I think beside Quebec city  it s the best choice  here are my reasons      Population  Las Vegas has a population in the area of   million  which is more than the following current NHL cities  San Jose  Columbus  Nashville  and Raleigh  It s also larger than Buffalo and a handful of Canadian cities with teams  but I didn t think it was fair to include them  Las Vegas may not be hockey crazy  but it has the size   twice over in some cases      Location  It has no other professional sports team  Seattle or Portland would have fun rivalries with Vancouver  but there is no competition for the  hometown team   which I think is the biggest plus  No other pro team for     miles      The team can be a tourist attraction and boost the teams across the league  people shell out      for a Cirque or other show so why not       for hockey  MGM AEG arena will seat         be open in       and I could easily see them giving out tickets as player comps or cheap family deals     million people visit each year  so they should have a decent amount of people rooting for the visiting team as well   The two biggest hurdles I see are no hockey history few local rinks for youth and keeping the Las Vegas atmosphere NHL friendly   P S   Check out the arena  it looks amazing   ,Thoughts on a Las Vegas expansion team,nhl

256,We constantly hear about players  rights and the CBA  I m  however  curious as to the important contract rights of both coaches and owners when it pertains specifically to NHL coaching contracts   Obviously  as a Pens fan  this is now more important than ever considering the recent decision to retain Bylsma for now   So  does anyone have insight into the how NHL head coaching contracts are structured ,Are teams allowed to actively search for a new head coach with a current coach still under contract ,nhl
265,Hey all  recently I ve noticed two Geico commercials  The first being the one where the two women are running competing on treadmills  A Bruins fan and a Flyers fan  and the Bruins girl falls down before the flyers fan  The second commercial being the one where there are a bunch of tents in some Arctic tundra and all the tents have a flag that has a teams logo on it  All of the other team tents have activity going on in front of them  people unpacking  a truck parked in front  etc    except for the Bruins tent which is lifeless  Do you think that perhaps the Bruins didn t pay Geico enough for advertising  ,Does Geico hate the Bruins ,nhl
272,Oh wait  Brandon Prust plays for the Habs   Never mind   No problem  no need for review or suspension ,OMG I hate how the Bruins forward Brandon Prust gave a headshot during the playoffs ,nhl
274,Can anyone honestly say that the way the referees handled last night s situation  positively   Prust hits Stepan high and late  taking Stepan out of the game temporarily  No call whatsoever instead of a likely deserved  game misconduct    I don t mean to sound like I believe there s some sort of conspiracy here  but the refs are not making themselves look good  This blown call has undeniably altered this series and the rest of the Rangers  playoff run    Minutes later a scrum occurs because the rangers are rightfully enraged  Now Carcillo has been a very disciplined player since becoming a New York Ranger  The man  has become a fan favorite    and that s remembering his past  I can t find good video of the situation  but the officials  did not handle the scrum well     That s from retired ref Kerry Fraser s twitter  I will not try to defend Carcillo s actions  Abuse of officials is a very serious offense  but the official put himself and Carcillo in a dangerous position by grabbing Carcillo the way he did   The Rangers lost last night  But they re also the losers in the entire situation  Carcillo has been issued an automatic    game suspension  NHL Rule       and Stepan found out he has a broken jaw this morning and is being operated on  Prust has a phone hearing this afternoon for his hit and will likely be gone   games   The referees caused a situation to go from bad to worse because of the way they handled themselves  They allowed an illegal action to undeniably benefit the perpetrator of the action  the prevention of which is precisely the reason they exist  This sort of thing should not be excusable   EDIT   u squeebie   found video that helps my point about Carcillo  here   ,The officiating situation has gone too far ,nhl
290,What do we do about it as fans  I hate seeing players get hurt on very dirty plays  I hate seeing refs interfering with players when they don t need to be  I am unbiased in these games as I do not have a dog in the fight my team lost in round       So  I ask my question again  What can we do to improve our game  ,I am disgusted with the refs in these playoffs  but    ,nhl

83,I don t know about you guys  but I couldn t be any more excited about the playoffs  I am a Bruins fan so naturally I think the B s will take the cup this year  but as we all know a hot goalie can put the team on his back and take his team to the promised land  Who do you think will win the Cup and why   Also  if you guys are looking for Playoff tickets check out     I was able to get some B s playoff tickets for less than      but they have other tickets for all kind of events        The reason I think this is the Bruins year  besides me being a biased fan      IMO there are not any teams that can match up with the Bruins  depth and physicality  The ability for the Bruins to rotate their   lines with confidence allows them to physically break down their opponents  Soderberg has really come into his own over the past few months and is very underrated  Could be the best  rd line center in the league  If I had to pick an achilles heel for the B s it would be their inexperienced D  namely Bartkowski  Krug  and Miller   What do you think ,Cup Predictions and Great Ticket Prices,nhl

334,The NHL s player safety department is a joke  The title of the disciplinary institution states that their job is to protect players  Right now  they are the main reason for player injuries  When Shanahan took over things did get better  however not nearly good enough   The recent incident involving Milan Lucic is very disturbing to me  Rule      of the NHL rulebook states   A match penalty involves the suspension of a player for the balance of the game and the offender shall be ordered to the dressing room immediately   A match penalty shall be imposed on any player who deliberately attempts to injure or who deliberately injures an opponent in any manner   It is clear that Lucic deliberately targets Danny DeKeyser s genitals  If this isn t considered a deliberate attempt to injure  I don t know what is  As the rule states  this act shall therefor result in a match penalty and a suspension  Instead Lucic receives no penalty  which I m not going to complain about since I am a referee myself  The fact that he only receives a       fine  when the rule clearly states he shall be suspended for the act is what disturbs me  I have never heard of an accidental spear  A spear is always deliberate and has to be considered an attempt to injure  Therefor a spear shall always result in a suspension  If the NHL takes player safety seriously and wants to eliminate acts such as spearing from the game  they have to do one simple thing  They have to send a message  They have to hand out a suspension that truly hurts  and have a minimum amount of games for the act   My idea is this  If a player spears an opponent the minimum penalty shall be a    game suspension  For a repeat offender the minimum should be    games  At first you may think I m being stupid  just hear me out  If players know that a spear will result in a    game suspension they won t do it  Maybe it will feel unfair to the first player to receive this penalty  However it is necessary  Handing out big suspensions will make players think twice before doing stupid things  ,Time for NHL to hand out lengthy suspensions,nhl

359,Over the past couple months I have been surfing around Reddit and other NHL blogs to see what non B liever s thought of my beloved Bruin s as they were amidst a    game run that landed them with the best record in the NHL  I was thinking   There is so much to talk about with the Bruins  where will they start   Possibly they will start by praising the Bruins depth and strength of farm system  after all  two of their top   defensemen have been down since the turn of the new year but instead of seeing the crumbling of a defense first team  we saw youngsters such as Dougie  Krug  Miller  and Bart the Polander stepping up their game and keeping the B s defense just as strong as ever  I mean  sure it hasn t been all roses for Krug Dougie and Bart  but hell  when it comes to the development of young defensemen in the NHL there is no success greater than failure  Or perhaps I would stumble across an article that talked about the emergence of defensive warrior Johnny  Rocket  Boychuck    Nope  the only article I stumbled upon about Johnny was how he was a dirty player for trying to  jump  PK Subban  Hmmmm trying to jump PK  I m pretty sure he was just trying to do PK a favor and show the world that PK doesn t stand for PussyKunt and get him to fight  but Mr  Subban did his best impression of a turtle and crumbled to the floor like a month old sugar cookie   I thought to myself   OK  maybe the NHL does not like the defensive minded Bruins so maybe I can find some positive posts about some of our forwards such as Milan Lucic and Riley Smith   And you know what  I did find an article about Smith  talking about his  uselessness  since the Olympic break  Yes  I admit his goal scoring might have tailed off a bit but there is more than just one way to measure a players effectiveness on the ice  In the past couple months Bergeron and Marchand s scoring has shot through the roof  and you want me to believe that it due to the third member of the line being nothing more than a traffic cone  Riley plays hockey the right way  sacrifices his body in the corners to free up pucks for more gifted players like Marchand to bury  Not to mention  it seems like every goal from the point I have seen this season has been aided by Riley planting his ass in front of the net Holmstrom style  Like do these so called hockey experts even watch the games or do they just look at the box score and see Riley has no goals and just base their assessment off of that  Now onto  the most underrated player in the NHL   Milan Lucic  I put that in quotes because those are not my words praising Milan but rather the words of former teammate and future hall of famer Jaromir Jagr  Instead reading about how great of a teammate this guy is sacrificing his body to make his linemates more productive and coming to teammate s defense at a moments notice I find posts on s condemning Looch as the second coming of Matt Cooke  I mean cut the shit  I can only sit back and watch these clowns belittle my team for so long before I lose my mind  I admit his crotchshot on Dekeyser was bullshit  but it is the playoffs and things like that happen all the time  Maybe if players would man up and drop their mittens every once and a while things like this wouldn t happen  But nope  our B s are still seen as the villains  meanwhile Orpik is still landing headshots and keeping his gloves sewn to his hands    The only fanbase I have been seeing love from is the Blues  but that is no surprise given their captain Mr Backes is the ultimate gamer who will score  assist  check  and beat the piss out of you if you mess with his team   As for my Favorite Eastern Conference fans  Penguins  Sucks to suck  time to upgrade from that traffic cone you have between the pipes  I don t want to hear about how dirty Thornton is because he finally gave Orpik what he had coming  We still owe you one for what you did to Savard  Keep your head on a swivel Syd  And stop bitching about players  roughing you up   heavy lies the crown and when you play on a team with perennial d bags like Neal and Orpik you are going to have a target on your back  Habs  What can I say about you that hasn t already been said by millions of Bruins fans before me  You sit on your high horse saying everyone else is cheap and cheaters meanwhile your players go down easier than a French Canadian hooker  Don t get me wrong  I am rooting heavily for you guys against the Lightning because I cant wait to see the Bruins beat the shit out of you and watch you and your coaches and your players cry to officials and try to draw penalties and poke the bear and then skate away from contact father than Rocket Richard on a breakaway  Your days are numbered as self proclaimed hockey royalty   ICE UP BITCHES   I guess what i want to know is why you all hate us  I understand it is partly because of fans like me  but you must understand i am a product of my environment  I am sick of reading anti lucic posts that label the bruins

41,What actually makes him the greatest player in the world  I m a Canucks fan  live in Vancouver and after the lose I watched the interviews after the lose and they kept referring to him as the greatest player in the world  I knew some fans  most Canadians and of course Pens fans consider him the best  but I didn t know players felt the same way   I m asking because I really don t think he s the greatest player in the world  As for the best offensive player I can give him that he can do some magical things with the puke not only scoring amazing goals  but setting up amazing goals   Come on Spezza keep up     But I would say Malkin is close if not better  As for the greatest hockey player I think you have to look at a player who plays amazing on both ends of the ice and for me that s Pavel Datsyuk  He is literally the craziest player I ve ever seen  He has won   been nominated for the Frank J  Selke Trophy many times  can snipe it from almost anywhere and if you give this guy some space  and sometimes even if you don t  he can deke as if you were a statue  I think the best part is he can play against people like Crosby and Malkin and be put on the ice to shut them down  This is what made that Pens Wings Stanley Cup Final x  so fun to watch for me   I m not bashing Crosby I think he s amazing  but on both ends of the ice I don t think he s as good as everyone makes him out to be ,Question about Crosby ,nhl

58,It just seems strange to me that in outdoor NHL games  there s almost no spectators at all next to the glass and there s a huge space from the grandstand to the rink  I understand that if the game is being held in an baseball park  it s a little difficult to do this  due to the asymmetrical shape  However football stadiums like Michigan Stadium could easily accommodate intimate seating  similar to how basketball games are laid out in indoor football stadiums   Speaking of which  why are there no hockey games played in large indoor stadiums  The NCAA Final Four routinely play in theses venues  as well as NBA games  the Raptors played in Rogers Centre  the Timberwolves played in the Metrodome   I can imagine the NHL All Star Game being played in Rogers Centre  Ford Field  or Cowboys Stadium and attracting large crowds  like the Winter Classic games ,Why are there no rinkside seats at outdoor hockey games ,nhl

122,I m watching the Australian Open right now and it makes me wonder  why can t the NHL use Hawkeye to rule whether or not a puck has crossed the line  Yes  the view can be obstructed by the net  players  equipment  but considering the Hawkeye technology can zoom in super close on a ball going extremely fast  I ve gotta think that it could be modified somehow to work in hockey  Thoughts ,Why can t hockey use Hawkeye ,nhl

180,I am about to rant so bear with me   About a month ago  I purchased a Niklas Kronwall Winter Classic jersey  I am a big Red Wings fan and I love the new jersey  Of course  I had to have one  As I walked around in it after purchasing it  I realized a tiny patch was falling off the sleeve  the alternate captain  A    I called the owner of the shop and he informed me it was supposed to be stitched  it only had adhesive  and recommended him or I  contact Reebok  I said I would do it because he was a nice guy and I didn t want him to go through the trouble  After all  it was just one patch  and I figured Reebok support would easily fix the small issue   I had never had a problem with Reebok in the past  I own about   Reebok jerseys from a variety of sports and have nothing but good things to say about the jerseys they supply  So I figured they would help me with such a minor issue  I was wrong   The first time I contacted them was over the the holiday break  I got an email informing me that they were on break  So I figured I would give them time for a respond  They never did   Since then    weeks   I sent two more emails and have still not gotten any sort of response  After being a Reebok purchaser for so long      years   I cannot believe they could not dignify my email with a response  Despite of how minor the issue is  the fact is that I spent      dollars on this jersey  That being said I expect things to not be falling off of it and I expect everything is done with the up most quality  The amount of un professionalism that I was shown by Reebok is not one I would expect from such a big company   Not only was I not offered  some sort of solution for the problem  But Reebok support would not even offer me a response  The fact that you are willing to ignore customers that have an issue with a mistake the factory made  leads me to believe that you don t take accountability for your own mistakes and that you don t respect your customers at all  NHL fans spend a lot of money on your products  and the fact you can t own up or fix a small mistake is just unacceptable   This will probably the last time I by any product with a Reebok logo on it  Because you would neither fix a small factory error or even offer me a simple response   you lost a customer   Eric  tl dr  Reebok screwed up on jersey  Never responded when contacted regarding a solution to the problem ,My open letter to Reebok   Rant  Please forgive me ,nhl

307,It s a fact of life  it seems  that when times are tough for the Washington Capitals  Alex Ovechkin takes an unfair share from grief from some members of the media  Some of that may come from being our resident superstar  and his path being so closely aligned with Washington s team success  Some of it seems to come from those that just like to fill up a couple of hours of talk radio  with little to no idea what goes on in our locker room  In the latter case  the knives came out again today on Alex in Toronto  More on that below   Thought it might be good to provide some common sense and statistics to back up the case for how valuable Alex Ovechkin is to the Washington Capitals  Thankfully  we have our statistical guru Arik Parnass   ArikParnass  on the case  What follows is a reasoned look  at why Alex Ovechkin is truly one of our game s most elite talents  Sometimes  it s good to dig a little deeper for the facts  rather than rely on personal opinions   My thanks to Arik for putting this together  Well done  sir   Capitals StatTalk   On Alex Ovechkin s Plus Minus  There are very few players in the NHL as polarizing as Washington Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin  When he s scoring  hockey fans   and Caps fans most of all   can t get enough of him as he rips one timers into the upper corner  performs jaw dropping dekes  and hammers the opposition into the boards  But as soon as this team begins to struggle  the criticisms emerge   He s not a good leader    He can t perform in the playoffs    I would rather have Gregory Campbell on my team    They won t win with him   These are tiring narratives that involve very little thought and even less research  No  the Capitals haven t had a lot of playoff success  It s a fact that the organization has had to deal with  But pegging it all on one player  a player who is over a point per game in the post season in his career  is misguided  It s easy to label a player a winner or a loser based on the outcome of a few short series  We see it in every sport  If Tom Brady of the New England Patriots  career had gone in reverse  he would probably have many of the same labels placed on him as Ovechkin today   Seven straight seasons on a good team without a Super Bowl Title  He must just be a pretty boy who can t get it done when it counts   But football is a team sport  just like hockey  And they are both games that are heavily impacted in the short term   whether people want to admit it or not   by luck  streaks and variance  It s why no NHL player has ever completed a full season with higher than a     shooting percentage  and why the Philadelphia Flyers made the Stanley Cup final riding two career backup or minor league goalies  The Boston Bruins are seen as winners  but they were a post away from being eliminated in the first round both of the recent years they made the Cup finals  Remember when Mike Green hit Halak s blocker in the dying minutes of Game   against the Montreal Canadiens down by one  In a strikingly similar alternate world  Mike Milbury calls out somebody like Milan Lucic for a lazy shift  and Alex Ovechkin is praised for playing the game the right way after winning a cup  And that brings us to plus minus  the stat that measures a player s two way results but for some reason is still seen as the go to exclusively defensive stat in hockey  Plus minus is the differential between a player s on ice goals for and on ice goals against  But there are a few caveats  First  it only includes goals scored at even strength  which makes some sense considering that power play guys will inherently get more chances to score and penalty kill players will get scored on more often  For some reason  however  the NHL decides to include shorthanded goals in the measure  So while a player can t get a     for a power play goal for  he can get a     for a shorthanded goal against  Furthermore  empty net goals against at even strength are included  That means that if a team pulls its goalie and the opposition scores  each player on the ice there will get a     or a     despite the fact that it was a hell of a lot easier for one of the teams to score than the other   And that brings us to Alex Ovechkin  Earlier today  former assistant Toronto Maple Leafs GM Bill Watters went on the radio in Toronto and blasted the Capitals  captain for amongst other things his  no leadership skills  and pointed out   as many have before   that his       rating  second lowest on the team  is inexcusable  Watters  however  went so far as to say that the team would in fact be better off without him  So let s look at what is behind Ovi s plus minus  and whether or not it is really as bad as it looks  To do so  let s first eliminate empty net and shorthanded goals from the equation  because they aren t representative of true even strength play  The Capitals this year have allowed six shorthanded goals  and Ovi has been on the ice for five of those  That takes him down to a        The captain has been on the ice for three empty net goals against and one empty net goal for  which means that we knock the ticker down to       Those in the stats world refer to this as  True      and it s a better tool for looking at a player s even strength success  But even with that  there are issues   The second big issue with plus minus as a metric is the fact that it s goal based  and as I ve mentioned here before  goals are rare enough events  even over the course of a season  that they tend to be heavily impacted by variance  While shooting percentages dip up and down like a roller coaster between seasons  shot based metrics tend to stay fairly stagnant  which makes them a better   not perfect  but better   predictor of true talent and future results  Consider also how often players will receive a     or a     after going to the bench or for a play in which they realistically took no part  That  noise    as it s referred to in the stats world   evens out over large periods of time  but can skew smaller samples  So what do Ovechkin s shot based metrics at even strength say about him  Ovechkin has a       Corsi percentage  the Caps take      percent of the total shots with him on the ice at even strength   which is third highest on the team amongst regular forwards and his highest since the Boudreau era  So why the       Well with Ovechkin on the ice at even strength  the Caps have shot only       That on ice shooting percentage ranks    th out of     forwards who have played at least     of their teams  games this season  In other words  a guy who has shot the lights out on the power play hasn t been getting the bounces at even strength  and neither have his linemates  On the other side of the coin  Caps goalies are only maintaining a      sv  with Ovechkin on the ice at even strength  That on ice save percentage ranks    th out of that same group of forwards  In both those statistics  Ovechkin is second last on his own team  which shows that although a small part of these issues may be systematic  a larger part of it is luck   Ovechkin is never going to have it easy in the NHL  at least not until he wins a Stanley Cup  He is a poster boy for laziness and selfishness  even though he has earned neither of those labels  It s easy to cherry pick statistics  just as it s easy to pinpoint bad shifts  but if you don t know how they fit into the bigger context  you will mislead yourself and others  The Capitals have work to do to get out of this slump  and the team s even strength play   while improved   is at the top of that list  But to look at one person  or even one very flawed statistic  as the source of the team s problems is simply wrong  Alex Ovechkin is the present and future of the Capitals  and that s still the way it should be  ,Give Ovi a Break  Mike Vogal  Arik Parnass,nhl

400,I m a huge Chicago sports fan  mostly watching the NBA and NFL  I ve always respected hockey to be one of the most rigorous and difficult sport to date but I ve never really had the chance to get into it  I ve tried many times to sit through a game and enjoy it but I could rarely even spot the puck and my impatient self would usually just zone out and resort to watching something else  Maybe it s due to the fact that I know nothing of the sport and my lack of knowledge deters me away from it  So what about hockey makes you continually watch and enjoy it   TL DR   I wanna watch hockey  convince me to watch hockey ,What about hockey do you love ,nhl
412,I m watching the feed of the Capitals Blue Jackets game out of Columbus  and I am seriously concerned that the fans in Ohio are being misled about the game of Ice Hockey   These announcers are some of the worst WHINERS I have ever experienced  and I used to watch  Smokin  Al Koken call games     I can t imagine Blue Jacket fans who listen to these two bozos getting anything like a clear picture as to what is and isn t a penalty in the NHL ,How do Columbus fans ever learn about the game ,nhl
431,So pretty much what the title says  I never liked soccer  which is by far the biggest sport here in Belgium  Cycling and tennis follow after that  which never appealed to me either   The few times I ve seen bits and pieces of hockey or movies around it made me love it  Are there any sites out there that would give me an explanation of the rules  the workings of the league  and maybe even online livestreams  Not much of a tv guy   My apologies if this kind of submission doesn t fit here  I didn t manage to find any subreddit rules ,I m European and never liked watching sports other than hockey and basketball  How do I get into watching NHL   becoming a fan ,nhl
432,I ve always been a big fan of the NHL video games and wanted to properly keep up with the actual league  but in the UK you have to pay for an extra channel to watch the games and stay up until the early hours of the morning  Does anyone know any good ways of keeping up with and watching the sport from the UK ,Any advice on how to get into NHL from the UK ,nhl
440,Apologies if this is the wrong place for this  I m looking at NHL Game Center Live  It s     dollars for the season   The equivalent for the NBA  my main sport  is about        Anyway  I went to watch a local team last night in Toyohashi  Japan  and I was pretty hooked on the idea of hockey immediately   Since I m not from America  I have no real allegiance to any particular city or team  I m a Bulls fan  so I guess maybe that link would make sense  It feels a bit cheap to immediately start following the current champs though  I chose the Bulls mainly because they had Luol Deng and I like the Blues Brothers  so that s the level of decision making going on here     My question is    if you were coming in fresh  with no tie to any team at all  and no geographical convenience factor   but knowing what you do now about the league  which team would you follow     Which teams play the most entertaining hockey    Which teams are being managed  correctly   not making dumb trades or handing out crazy contracts  drafting well etc   and are likely to not end up frustrating the hell out of you for years to come   you don t want to end up following the NHL equivalent of the Cavaliers   Personally  I tend to pay more attention to teams in places I want to visit  so that would put Seattle  Vancouver BC  Portland  Denver  Chicago  and San Francisco higher up in my preference list   I literally wouldn t be able to tell you the name of a single current NHL player  that s how much of a newbie I am to the sport  So any help or discussion in here would be very helpful interesting ,Am English  Went to watch local hockey last night  Want to start watching NHL  Which team should I get into ,nhl
443,I was gonna ask this on the subreddit  but they only allow linked posts  Any help would be awesome  Thanks ,Can anyone recommend to me any good Hockey podcasts or Youtube talk channels ,nhl
444,I m a basketball fan  some time ago someone on session  which is ending and I ll have tons of time   I was into NFL for half a season          soccer has got boring  I was born a soccer fan  but now I limit it to FPL and  r soccer   so maybe bunch of bearded Canadians hitting each other with sticks  sorry for the stereotype  will be fun to watch      I think I know basic rules of the game  but I would like you to give me a short description of each team  what an NHL season looks like  who s been good  who s been terrible last couple of seasons  I would appreciate if you named some games from recent seasons that would really convince me        Thanks if you got through that terribly put together bunch of words ,I want to get into hockey  Where should I start ,nhl

458,Besides for being absolutely ridiculous  the new playoff format raises some questions that I hope someone can help me with   I understand that the set up is that the first two rounds of the playoffs will be played within each division  so that for the semi finals each division will have one representative  the two eastern conference teams will play each other  and the same for the west  and the stanley cup finals will match one team from the west with one team from the east  The asterisk is  of course  for the exception that only   teams from each division will automatically make the playoffs and the last   spots in each conference will be wild card spots that can be held by teams in either division   If one team from each division gets a wild card spot then they play within their division s playoff for the first   rounds and all is well   But  if both wild card teams come from the same division one will be sent to play in the other division s playoff for the first   rounds   So my questions are        Which of the   wild card teams gets sent to the other division   According to this page    on espn com it is the wild card team with less points that gets shipped to the other division  however this doesn t really make much sense to me   Shouldn t the team that has less points  and is theoretically not as good  stay to play the one seed from their own division so that the champion of that division gets a  theoretically  easier series   Don t they deserve it for winning the tougher decision  Using the current standings in the eastern conference my example is that right now Montreal     pts  and Detroit     pts  would get the two wild card spots  and Detroit would go to the Metropolitan Division playoffs  but is this fair to Boston   Pittsburgh would play Detroit  and they do have more points than Boston  but presumably in an easier division  this might not be actually true  but in theory it could be  Or  perhaps the reason why Detroit gets swapped and not Montreal is because Pittsburgh has more points than Boston   That would seem fair to me  but I m not sure if that is the actual reason      If the second wild card team gets swapped divisions  do they automatically receive the   seed   For instance  if Detroit has more points than Columbus  does Detroit still end up as the   seed and Columbus the   seed   If that is the case than Pittsburgh  the   seed  will be playing a team with more points in the first round than the Rangers  a   seed   That doesn t seem fair either   This all may sound confusing and rather pedantic  and in reality to win the Stanley Cup you just have to beat everybody you play and if you do lose to a team early on then you don t deserve the cup anyway  but if we are going to place some importance on the regular season than it has to be so that the teams that do better get better seeds in the playoffs and more likely than not have an easier road through the bracket ,A couple of questions about the new playoff format,nhl

161,And even if it does dilute the talent pool  I think this is the best thing that could possibly happen to hockey  With so many more talented players coming out of Europe and the U S and better training programs there are more  better players than there has ever been      And I would love to see someone put up points like Gretzky and Lemieux did again but it will never happen when everyone is on such a level playing field  we would probably need    teams to see that kind of success again  if not more      I think diluting the talent pool would be the easiest way to bring up scoring in the NHL  but the fact is that adding another   or   or even   teams is not going to make that much of a difference  There are entire teams in Europe  while they wouldn t win many games in the NHL would compete   I know one of the NHL teams lost in Finland this year during exhibition       Take the top     guys not playing in the NHL and I bet you make some alright NHL teams  spread them around the league and I bet there isn t a discernible difference in quality       There may be some valid concerns with expansion  but talent certainly is not one of them  ,Getting tired of the expansion haters that think it will dilute the talent pool ,nhl

381,I m just getting into Hockey  and I m loving it so far  I love the fast pace of the game most of all  even if goals aren t being scored  It reminds me of soccer but a lot quicker  So  my questions      What is Icing  Is it when you try to spray another play by skidding on your skates      What are the rules for fighting  For checking      What is a Power Play and how is one started  Also are there any similar game  scenarios  I should know about  I get the sense it has something to do with penalties      What is the significance of the little blue circle in front of the goal      What do the other lines on the ice mean  Like that big blue line      Why is it that sometimes one team can t have a goalie in the net  Is this related to Power Plays Penalties      How does  playcalling  work in Hockey  And also  timeouts  I have never seen a player look like they are actively receiving any instruction from the sideline  is the coach making calls I just cant hear see       I thought I heard an announcer say something about offsides  so how does offsides work in Hockey and is it different from soccer   And anything else you think I should know  would be appreciated   edit  Another one I forgot that has been nagging at me  what does it mean to  kill a penalty  or to not kill one  I would think its when a foul is called that leads to a player going   on   with the goalie   edit    The Avalanche goalie  team I chose to root for  seemed like he had an INSANE game tonight  Just save after save after save XD,New Hockey NHL fan here  can someone explain some of the rules to me please ,nhl

107,Alright hockey fans    I m new to watching hockey  a friend of mine just got me interested  and there have been a few things I ve wondered about fights   I found NHL fight etiquette list and it said things such as    Players  enforcers  explain that title if you will   will respect a rival players decline of a fight if he has an injury bothering him     It s frowned upon to fight someone at the end of their shift    It also says that a reason a lot of fights may happen early  without any instigation  is because they don t want it to be declined due to injuries   So here are my questions      Why would they fight early on without instigation  Is there a point to it      The point of a fight is to win  but with these rules  it never gives anyone an upper hand  isn t that what you want in a fight      what do players fight about the most   I may have more questions  but can t think of them right now   But reading that stuff made me feel like it s a bunch of buddies just fighting to give the crowd something to watch   I don t mean to sound stupid  I m just really curious   Thank you in advance for the answers , Serious  question about fights in the NHL ,nhl

131,As I m sure everyone is well aware  during the Canadian anthem  the Jets  fans belt out  TRUE NORTH   with extra gusto as a tribute to True North Sports   Entertainment  the group company that owns the Jets   Obviously this appears at Jet road games  and given the number of Jets  fans at the Jets Wild game tonight in Minnesota  it would have been heard loud and clear on any broadcasts   So what do they do   They whip out the version of the anthem that combines portions of the English and French versions   Coincidentally  the French parts occur when  The true north strong and free  would occur in the English version  meaning there was nothing to belt out   I already like this rivalry ,I have to hand it to the people who coordinate the anthem s  for Minnesota,nhl

287,So  here I sit with my brother  gathered around the Thanksgiving hors d oeuvres  having a conversation about the overtime rules and point system currently employed by the NHL   I think that the    point for overtime  rule really lowers the intensity and level at which the game is played at  and  personally  I despise the shootout   My brother disagrees   He loves the shootout and the one point given for overtime   If I could have it my way  the shootout would be retired  and two   minute overtime periods would be played  both   on    and if the teams were still knotted at the end of those  a tie would be declared and then and only then would each team be given   point   If a team won it in overtime  it would be treated as a normal win    points to the winner  zero to the loser   So  my question is  what would your ideal overtime rules look like  ,r NHL  a penny for your thoughts ,nhl

334,Hey guys  I ve been lurking for a bit  and you guys seem like a great community  I am from Chicago  and I am a Blackhawks fan  When I was growing up and watching sports in  nd grade for the first time  I followed every team on TV  However  until recently  the Blackhawks did not have a TV deal so I never got to see them play  This  combined with the fact that my parents wouldn t let me play hockey because it was too expensive  dunno if thats true  they probably were afraid or something   led to me never developing a love for the sport   The first time I started watching hockey was in       I knew the Hawks were good  so I watched each of their playoff games  That was super fun  Then I did the same thing this year  watched every playoff game  and got to see another great playoff run   So I know I am a spoiled hockey brat in the sense that my team is having a ton of success and I am not a good enough fan to deserve or appreciate it  I have played some of the NHL video games  and I own NHL    and it is super fun   Anyway that is my background on hockey  What is the best way for me to get into this sport  What are some of the best websites I should be reading  How do I know how to evaluate how skilled players are  For instance  almost every goal I see seems like luck to me  which I know is stupid  but it seems to often be a mad scramble in front of the net  As much fun as hockey is for me to watch  I never know what is happening   If you guys could just give me some recommendations of resources I should be checking out as a completely new NHL fan  that would be awesome   Thanks ,I m relatively new to hockey  where do I start ,nhl

186,       The Colorado Avalanche again have had yet another disappointing season in the NHL  With their last playoff berth in          the Avalanche continue to disappoint fans by placing near the bottom of the league two years in a row  With newly added Patrick Roy as head coach and young Nathan Mackinnon  the Av s look to change their future         This years entry draft General Manager Joe Sakic made a very shocking decision  Instead of drafting No    overall defence man Seth Jones  he took Nathan Mackinnon  In their current place as   th in the NHL for goals against allowing     goals in    games this past season  drafting a defender seemed to be the obvious choice  Yes Nathan is speedy centre and has the potential to be a point per game NHL star  but offence is not what the Avalanche organization needs  Personally I m puzzled why Joe Sakic did not draft Seth Jones  Playing in the WHL for the Portland Winter hawks  Jones put up an impressive    points in    games  Not only is he a           pound shut down defence man  he can put up the offensive numbers on the blue line  On the power play this year the Av s placed   th in the NHL  With Seth Jones and Erik Johnson at the point  the power play conversion rate could have improved dramatically  While their number one net minder Semyon Varlamov had some solid games and is an NHL starting goaltender  he can t preform well with the defence he has in front of him         As we have seen the negative of not drafting Seth Jones  here s the positive of having Nathan Mackinnon on your roster  In the         QMJHL season  Mackinnon put up    points in    games  The following year Nathan hit an impressive    points in just    games  This amazing skater and fantastic puck handler has a natural talent for goal scoring  Along with his quick hands  Mackinnon is surprisingly physical and is not afraid to battle for the puck along the boards or in front of the net  He is the full package for a starter at centre            Here is the current Colorado Avalanche roster  Gabriel Landeskog                    Matt Duchene                    P A  Parenteau Alex Tanguay                       Paul Statsny                      Jamie Mcginn Cody Mcleod      Ryan O Reilly                  Steve Downie      Tyson Barrie                    Matt Hunwick                               Jan Hejda              Stefan Elliott       Erik Johnson     Cory Sarich    Semyon Varlamov  Jean Sebastien Giguere         Now down to their forwards  First off when you look at this team  you immediately notice their strength down the middle  Matt Duchene  as their number   centre  put up    points in    games  Duchene has a natural feel for the puck and can put up solid numbers making him one of the most feared players for any goaltender  Playing second line centre is silver medalist in the      olympics Paul Stastny  Stastny has not lived up to expectations over the past few years  After signing a   year deal in         for    million  Stastny s point total has declined from    points in the         season  This past season Stastny put up only    points in    games  While he was rumoured to be on the trading market throughout this past year and offseason  the Av s have decided to keep him  If Stastny can find chemistry with his line mates and be the    point player a year he is  the Avalanche will have a much better shot at the playoffs  The  rd line introduces young centre Ryan O Reilly  After all that commotion with the offer sheet earlier this year  O Reilly preformed very well hitting    points in    games  He is every teams dream  rd line centre  Not only is he a high skilled playmaker  but he can be a reliable point producer for this streaky team         Playing the wing along side Duchene is P A  Parenteau  Pierre Alexandre had a breakout season with the Islanders in the        season reaching    points  He returned the following year and put up a solid    points tallying    assists  This season with the Av s he hit    points in just    games  P A  Parenteau is one of the most underrated play makers in the NHL  He has a deep understanding of the game and can make unbelievable plays with his passing ability                               Then there s the famous Gabriel Landeskog  the youngest captain in NHL history at only    years of age  Many believed the pressure would shake the young Swede  and it did  After reaching    points in            Gabriel scored only    points in    games this past season  The pressure built on his shoulders and he collapsed  But this isn t the end of him  he has an amazing skating ability and can dangle his way out of trouble  We have only seen the beginning of this remarkable swede          Recently the Avalanche traded for forward Alex Tanguay  Many people look down at this trade and criticized Colorado for picking him up but I think that he will benefit the  th youngest team in the NHL with his expertize and experience  That meaning don t expect him to put up the numbers he used to  Tanguay can also chip in a little on the power play as he has the ability to control the play and can pass the puck very well  He will be good for     maybe     points depending if he can pick up chemistry with Paul Stastny          As the Avalanche have built their forwards and have a very talented group of goal scorers and playmakers  their defence could be much better  Having Matt Hunwick and Tyson Barrie as their top two isn t the greatest  I m not saying they re bad players per say  but they are definitely not ready to be a top two defensive pair on an NHL team  First off what the Av s need is a fully developed NHL ready defence man who can tally       points a year and can be the shut down D men that they desperately need  That player was to be supposed Erik Johnson  Drafted number one overall in the      entry draft by the St Louis Blues  Johnson ended up with the Avalanche  In his rookie year he tallied    points in    games with the Blues  This past year  he hit only four points in    games  Expectations were and are very high on    year old Erik Johnson  Johnson definitely has some making up to do  One thing that Johnson and the team can benefit from is an experienced D man that could be mentors to these players  Could former Avalanche pick in the      entry draft Tom Gilbert be the answer  As of now Gilbert seems to be KHL bound but I think he could be a good addition to a struggling defensive teams like the Av s  Since hitting    points with the Oilers in the       seasons  the           pound defence man point total has dropped tremendously over the years  This doesn t mean he is completely useless  as he can reach    points and be an effective go to defence man and help out on the penalty kill  With    million in cap space  Joe Sakic should definitely take a look at Gilbert  Another viable option is the aging Filip Kuba  This Czech defender has a powerful slap shot at the point and back in the day  he was a consistent    point player  Yes Kuba is not the player he was back with the Senators and Wild  but his contributions would be more off the ice than on  Kuba can provide playoff experience and leadership in the locker room  He can be a mentor to the younger players  Another benefit is that he is relatively healthy playing    out of    games last season with the panthers          Once the Colorado Avalanche pick up at least two more defenders and Erik Johnson and Paul Stastny have a rebound year  this team will be on the right track to a playoff berth  ,Why the Colorado Avalanche will be the next big team,nhl

399,I just started watching hockey last year  I mean i ve watched it before then  but not every single game as i do now  I m starting to really understand the game  but the tampa bay lightning confuse me on their status and current condition  I do think they gave Boston a really good fight even though falling short      If it wasn t for their goal keeper  Rask  who played outstandingly good   I honestly think boston would ve been stomped on  They were out shot        Lost their first fight  and the second fight was even in my opinion  refs broke it up but lots of punches thrown  but enough to pump up the lightning to tie it up to       Also the tampa bay lightning i ve noticed has a way stronger and bigger team now  Labrie   Gudas being the strongest but even the rookies like Johnson who even though not big made himself known in that game    The only thing that I know sets them back is their goalies  Bishop I deff think is a great goalie  Every game i ve seen him in he does great  typically   Lindback though drives me nuts  beginning of last season he was untouchable  barely ever let pucks go by him  now every time he s in net i just see what should be simple saves turn into goals for the opposing team  I do give him props on a few good saves he made tonight  but some of the pucks that went by him tonight kind of made me roll my eyes    Whether it s his fault or the D s fault though i m stilll trying to figure out   The defense as well is DEFINITLY an improvement since last year  however they still made a few mistakes tonight two of them being costly  Break away  and a penalty shot for Boston   Someone that has a lot more experience in hockey analysis i d prefer to hear from though  these are just my opinions  Not trying to sound too one sided either  sorry if i did  Lightning is my team so it s hard not too lol    Even though we lost tonight I was still proud of the overall performance of the team  and the game i watched tonight  It was pure  great  well played hockey on both ends    Now please tell me your views and thoughts of the lightning  thanks   D ,Tampa Bay Lightning analysis anyone ,nhl

493,I ve been pondering this conundrum for quite some time   I ve always been an NHL fan  but I was never QUITE sure which was my favorite team   THE CANDIDATES  I grew up in Cleveland  OH  a pretty big hockey town   But we don t have an NHL team   I tended to follow the Red Wings most closely as a kid  because they were nearby and had those great teams in the late   s early   s  but it felt weird rooting for a Michigan team   Maybe I could be a Stars fan  since the Cleveland Barons were absorbed by the Minnesota North Stars who then moved to Dallas   That doesn t quite feel right   We had the Cleveland Lumberjacks growing up  the IHL affiliate of the Penguins   My parents are from NYC  and we d go to Rangers games sometimes when we went there to visit family   I lived in Denver for a while as a small child  so when they got the Avalanche  which was after I moved away  I thought maybe that could be my team   They even won the Stanley cup in their first season   But it didn t stick   I went to college in Washington DC  and I went to a bunch of Caps games  and even got a Caps jersey   I then transferred to Ohio State  at the exact same time Columbus got the Blue Jackets   I decided I d become a Blue Jackets fan  after    years of confusion   But they just never quite did it for me either   After college I spent a couple years in LA and thought maybe I d become a Kings fan   But it just didn t happen   I now live in the Raleigh Durham area and have been to a couple Canes games  but again  they just haven t really gripped me at any point   Help  Who is my team   I think the Red Wings are probably the leading candidate  but they just don t feel quite right  like the Indians  Browns and Cavs do  you know ,Which NHL team am I a fan of ,nhl

67,When people go on and on about the lack of coverage of the NHL on ESPN today  they point out that NHL has no games on any ESPN network   The argument goes   Why would ESPN give any time to a sport that s not aired in its family of networks    The           English Premier League will start tomorrow with no games on the ESPN family of networks anymore with the new NBC deal   I think it will be interesting to see how much ESPN covers the         EPL season vs        NHL season  And other sports    Any thoughts on this   If the theory that ESPN gives NHL no love because they don t have rights to it has merit  then this season should see a significant drop off in ESPN s EPL coverage  correct ,ESPN s Coverage of the EPL  no rights for ESPN  will be interesting as it relates to NHL,nhl

132,I actually got the opportunity to meet team canada preliminary roster in calgary at a restaurant where they were having a team bonding  I got    signatures and   pictures  I got to meet Jonathan Toews  John Tavares  Steven Stamkos  Martin St Louis  Jordan Staal   Corey Perry  Taylor Hall  Jordan Eberle  Shea Weber  PK Subban  Dan Boyle  Roberto Luongo  Corey Crawford and Lindy Ruff  The whole team was basically sitting beside us in a VIP section but as the players were leaving me and my friend got to meet them  I really wanted to meet sidney crosby but he booked it out of the place with   escorts  Eberle  Stamkos  Luongo  Lindy Ruff  Dan Boyle and Taylor hall were probably the nicest guys there which surprised me cause taylor hall looks like a massive douche  Carey Price  Corey Perry and John tavares were the biggest losers there though  Martin St Louis was real chill he didn t talk much but he was a good guy dude is definitely shorter than he looks he is probably     and at most probs      Carey Price and Corey Perry wouldn t take a picture with me and i didn t even bother asking Tavares he was just a douche who didnt even finish the signature on my shirt  I almost got kicked out on top of that because some douche who was helping the players out came over and threatened to kick me out but he ended up leaving with Crosby which opened the door for me to meet a lot more players  Stamkos was so nice that he even held up a napkin of my friends name who couldn t make it and took a pic with me   P K subban was real cool dude to he took signed my shirt went to the bathroom and came out and took a pic with me and my friend and walked off with some girl  It was real funny cause corey crawford said no to sign my shirt but he did it anyways haha  On top of that NO HOMO I went to the bathroom and got a text and whipped out my phone and put it up to my face and brad marchand thought i was taking a picture of him pissing    He also looks shorter than he actually is in real life hes probably          The next day I actually got to meet a couple guys from the TSN hockey panel James Duthie  Bob Mckenzie and Darren Dreger they were all really nice especially James Duthie dude was hammered   I told him that I was watching him all day to see if they would give any details on meeting the players he told me to get a girlfriend and he actually ended up telling me the best place to meet the players  I eventually got to meet Marc and Jordan Stall and Chris Kuntiz a couple minutes later and  they were super chill dudes especially Chris Kunitz he was cracking jokes and all and he even told me what time the players were going and leaving the arena  Just to keep it short I met sidney crosby twice and i backed off and didnt get his autograph and let other people get it but I did ask for a picture and he said he would but the people he was with said he couldnt and they took him away but i eventually got his autograph and the dude stole my sharpie  I screamed at him saying he did and even screamed at the people he was with and he gave me the sorry i dont have it look with his arms shrugging and his entourage said they didn t have it  I am actually pretty rattled about it when everyone is saying how cool it is that sidney took it  I pulled an all nighter to meet him and i eventually did the next morning which was pretty sweet  I can see why some players are don t sign because of some losers who have like    of these players autographs and just follow them everywhere Its funny cause this one dude I met had   crosby signatures and when brad merchand came he asked him for an autograph and didn t sign shit for him but signed for me hahaha  For everyone who thinks Dion Phaneuf is a douche you are retarded because he legit hung up with whoever he was on the phone with to take a photo and sign my stuff for me and the next day he was so welcoming  I helped the teams bus driver move the rope that blocks the fans and the players and then after I did that I asked him if he could take me on the bus to get some more autographs or if he could take my shirt and get it signed but he told me he couldn t and said that if you help people good thinks will happen to you so this is a message for all you people out there  Rick Nash did not sign once and he straight bolted for the bus which surprised me cause he seems so cool  Carey price is a pretty big douche and I have lost a lot of respect for him  When he was leaving for his car he was with P K and they put their stuff away and P K  came back to sign autographs where Carey didn t even look over once and went straight for the car  All i gotta say is Steven Yzerman is stricly business and the only reason i got his autograph is because i cut him off when he was walking towards the hotel and he did not say one word at all  FYI Drew Doughty  Kris Letang are massive partiers  I met a lot of players and im glad their were fans as dedicated as me out there who kept me motivated to stay dudes showed up hammered to the hotel when i saw them and some dirt on the players is when Price  Subban and one more player i forget showed up to the hotel the cab driver didn t know who they were but he told me the whole drive from the place he picked them up to the hotel they were talking about how many girls they banged and stuff like that LOOOOL  In all in all I ended up being short of    players autographs and got   managements autographs  If you think I am bragging about meeting all these players please don t be I am just telling you guys my experience with these players and I have been dying to meet these players since I was a kid because they usually have the orientation camp in my city and I got the opportunity to go this time around so why not  If you take this the wrong way i apologize for your bitter attitude towards me and please do move on in life  ,Anyone on reddit know any nhl players personally or have had any experiences meeting nhl players,nhl

207,Hey everyone    I was contemplating if the Nhl should have larger ice surfaces like the Khl  I really belive that the dead puck era is coming back and size is more of a factor than skill  The players are so big now there s no room to play out there  so it seems    I think a bigger rink would ensure player safety  or at least compared to now  It would keep skill really high  and size would also matter as there is more room to hit or run players    Am I wrong   Please explain your views   sorry English is not my first language but I became a huge hockey fan  ,Bigger ice surface   more skill ,nhl
222,There s something I ve been thinking about for a long time now  I know there s more to the entry draft than just drafting the guys with the highest numbers  but how do teams decide a guy like Maxime Talbot  who had    points and     PIMs in his draft year  and    pts in    playoff games   isn t worth picking higher than the  th round when Boyd Gordon had similar numbers  but way fewer PIMS and    pts in    playoff games     I know they played in different leagues and that hindsight is        but I don t think it was hard to see that Talbot would become a solid NHLer ,Scouting and drafting question,nhl

193,How would an NHL expansion work  I ve done some research and there are basically two options       Expansion teams sign free agents     Although there are many  decent  free agents available  you would certainly not be able to draw enough fan support having a team consisting of Scott Gomez and Hal Gill  Expanding one team from free agents seems non logical  let alone two teams that will ride the bottom seed for many many years  If you read  this    article  the teams are built around washed up veterans that IMO wouldn t do well       Expansion Draft    From my understanding  teams would be able to protect a certain number of players  No where could I find the amount of players though  Nor could I find if prospects would be protected  This option seems to benefit the expansion teams more  but could really hurt some power teams when trying to decide who to keep  prospects vs   rd liners     EX    A team like Boston is built off all   of their   lines  so it would really hurt their team structure trying to hand pick the players that mean the most to them  However  if you place Malkin and Crosby on any team they re bound to make a playoff run  ,Expansion Draft,nhl

204,When the Bruins D plays phenomenal in front of Tuukka  Tuukka gets a shutout and plays  great  and gets a ton of credit  When the Bruins D plays horrible like last night  it s not Tuukka s fault at all  just bad defense  When a defense plays as good as the B s played in game    more credit should go to the great defense and WAY less to the goaltender  It doesn t seem fair to me to not put blame on a goalie after a loss when they get all the credit after a win  Defense wins games way more than a goalie  I m not saying Rask deserves no credit  but make sure to look at how great that defense was in game   before saying that all the praise should go to Rask  ,Goalies and defense ,nhl

267,I m not going to pretend I m a seasoned hockey fan  I picked up watching it a few years ago  And yes  I m a Bruins fan  but that s irrelevant to this matter for the most part  I ve watched other sports  mainly soccer  since I can remember  so I m familiar with commentary  and feel like I can recognize when a side is being taken  Soccer got boring to watch  duh   so I picked up watching hockey  The game s awesome  I love it   So these commentators have done a pretty good job for the most part on the playoffs  but this series  they ve really been pissing me off  to the point where I d rather mute the TV  It stinks  because I like hearing the stats and learning more about the game  but there isn t a minute of the series that they haven t been kissing Chicago s ass  And I m not saying anything bad about Chicago  they re a great team  and it s been an awesome series so far  But when Chicago s winning  it s because Chicago is playing great  When Boston is winning  Chicago  isn t playing their game    During the     game  replays were abundant for Chicago goals and plays  The announcers were breaking down the goals  commending them on deflected goals and whatnot  Yet  when Boston equalizes with great passing and a stunning shot  not a word is muttered  If it is  it s what Chicago did wrong   What really kind of pissed me off was when they said one of our players  I think Lucic   sold the call  on a high stick  They re played it  and he clearly got smacked hard in the mouth  and they were insistent that he was still selling it   Am I just crazy  or have these guys been extremely biased this entire series   Either way  I m looking forward to tonight  Go Bruins  but if Chicago wins  congrats  Whoever gets the cup this year will have earned it ,I have a serious problem with these announcers  Can anyone else agree ,nhl

97,Penguins Vs  Senators   I think the senators give Pitt a serious run  all the way to the end  Pitt is a better team than Montreal  especially with Sid healthy ish  but I don t see the Sens giving the pens any ground  The Isles and sens are similar  young teams  however  the sens have very diverse scoring  and a real threat on the blue line in karlsson  I see Vokoun getting tired after   hard games  and this one goes all    I see Sens in    probably with OT in several games    Bruins Vs  Rangers   The bruins have one major weakness that was clear in the toronto series  and that is scoring  especially against a hot goalie  not to mention the king of hot goalies   However  I think Claude Julien knows his players like no other coach  and as a team  when the bruins find a new gear like they did in the third period against toronto  they are one of the hardest teams in the league to beat  I think New Yorks greatest weakness is similar to boston s  but is harder to solve  Nash is obviously their premier scorer  and a talented one at that  however players like brassard have been leading their offense  which isn t necessarily a good thing  I think a Chara Nash matchup favors boston  and i think the depth and experience of the bruins d corps is strong enough to deal with a Rangers team with out Gaborik the Bruin killer IF they are healthy  I doubt injuries to Ference and Seidenberg Redden are serious  but if they miss more than a game or two this series changes entirely  I think Boston s undeniably incredible comeback win will give them a serious boost in this one  but i think this series goes for the long haul  Unless Lundqvist can pull of something Tim Thomas esque  I think boston takes this in      Hawks Redwings   Hawks are a seriously confident bunch that are young  fast  deep  and hungry  The redwings are grizzly  experienced veterans that will not go easily  I think that this comes down to defense  especially for Detroit  They did an incredible job shutting down a hot young team in Anaheim  and i think they COULD do it again against chicago  however  I don t think they will  I think Kronwall and his younger counterparts will put up a hell of a good fight  but without lidstrom  i don t think this detroit team can do enough  The only way they pull this off is with a fiery brutish hot streak from BOTH Zetter and Datsyuk  not one or the other  both need to show up big time to puyll anything off  Chicago in      Los Angeles Vs San Jose   This is the trickiest one  I think it comes down purely to luck  Both Niemi and Quick have been standing on their heads  Both D corps have been fantastic  Kopitar has been excellent  as has Brown and Richards  but conversely  Marleau  Couture  Thornton  Pavelski  and  somewhat surprisingly  Torres have all been showing up BIG time for the sharks  Sweeping Vancouver is no easy task  no matter how much drama goes on with them  and all the credit for that series win lies with the Sharks  not the shortcomings of the Canucks  This comes down to a few odd bounces and a plethora of highlight reel saves at both ends of the ice  San Jose in      So  there you have it  I was right for all but one of my first round picks  give or take a game or two     st round picks    Pens in      Bruins in     Senators in     Capitals in       Hawks in     Red Wings in     San Jose in     LA in  ,Second round picks,nhl

129,I ve only recently started taking hockey seriously being a Brit who immigrated to Canada a couple years ago  so please bear that in mind    First of all I d like to say that I absolutely love hockey   The excitement  intensity  big hits  fights  I love it  Being a Brit obviously it hasn t yet begun to compete with Football  soccer  for me but it s closer than I could have imagined before starting to watch the sport    What I haven t been able to wrap my head around though is the overall format of the league  The top   teams from each conference progress to the playoffs  fine   but for teams that find themselves out of contention for the playoffs early on they find themselves in the strange postion of having incentive to lose games in order to attain a better draft position  For me any system that allows this to be the case is surely deeply flawed  There is of course the draft lottery that certainly helps the matter but it does not completely remove these strange inventives  In soccer there is a relegation system in place that removes the relegates the bottom   sides in place of the top   sides of a lower division  AHL    and if you ask any soccer fan this is about the worst fate you can endure in the sport  This ensures competitive games throughout the season and removes the tricky scenario of games in which playoff contenders are pitted against teams who have nothing to play for  therefore giving an unfair advantage to this playoff side since other teams may not have to opportunity to play these playoff irrelevant sides  I understand that it just might not be possible to instil a relegation system  or could it  I m still largely new to the game so I m not sure how you would implement a potential system such as this    Secondly  whilst the playoffs are certainly the highlight of a hockey fans season and provide a great amount of entertainment  could this be at the cost of a relevant regular season  Allow me to explain  From what I can tell as long as you make the playoffs  you re  pretty much  one and the same  Of course you play for seeding and home advantage but when these advantages are analysed they really don t amount to all that much  Home advantage statistically comes to       in the NHL playoffs  marginally less that Basketball which is sport that enjoys the greatest home advantage payoff  And so  providing it does go to a game    the home side  theoretically  enjoys a relatively small advantage  I say theoretically because it should be said that over the past five years away sides have actually fared a great deal better than the home sides in the playoffs  Whether this is due to the pressure the players feel playing in front of their own fans  who knows   I m just speculating  As far as seeding goes  if we take away the lunacy of having the division leaders making up the top   instad of the top   sides in the conference  the teams seem so closely matched that much of the playoff matchups come down to form  So for instance who on earth would fancy taking on the Blue Jackets this year  or the Red Wings for that matter  as the ducks can attest   In fact the lower seed won in more matchups this year in the first round  And you just have to look at last years final to realise that seeding really isn t a hugely defining factor    In summary  pretty much the only relevant months for teams who know they are going to make the playoffs are essentially April and May  the playoffs themselves  For teams who aren t going to make the playoffs you want to be as low as possible to secure a good draft pick  the difference between a Crosby and a Ryan is one place   HUGE for the future of the franchise  There really isn t that much up for grabs over the season  yes the playoffs are great but most of the season is a bit redundant in my opinion   Sorry for the long post   Don t expect many to read it but perhaps someone can enlighten me   This is not to bash the sport  I m willing to accept soccer s downfalls  diving  sportsmanship  time wasting etc etc  but I really don t understand the logic of the system ,Structural Problems In the NHL ,nhl

383,The Pens and Bruins are going to make for one hell of a series  Both teams till out   extremely solid lines  and I think both teams have strengths to counter any weaknesses the other will exploit  Pittsburgh has better goal scorers   Crosby  Neal  Malkin beat anything the Bruins has  However the defense and goaltending cancels that out   The wild cards for both teams in my opinion   Does Jagr go into  Fuck you Pittsburgh  mode  If so he can cause chaos especially on the power play  Do the Penguins ignore defense  If they start to crack defensively they are going to have a bad time  Can Vokoun stay hot  Can Matt Cooke fuck with the Bruins to get them off their game  Savard memories still linger   Does Murray and Chara  scrap  It would be awkward  yet awesome   Thinking back to the regular season the Pens owned the Bruins  and have not had issue with Rask  Even though you really can t base anything off the regular season  I don t think the Bruins are fast enough to hang with the Pens  Look what Toronto was able to accomplish    I m thinking Pens in      Predictions  Game     Bruins     Game     Pens     Game     Pens     Game     Bruins     Game     Pens      OT  Game     Bruins     Game     Pens    ,Pens vs  Bruins discussion predictions,nhl

475,I would say the LA Kings have always been a mediocre to average team  From           they did not even qualify for the play offs  And they lost quarterfinals the   years prior from winning the championship    I don t pay attention to hockey but he teams I always hear via ESPN or radio are the Bruins  Rangers  Red Wings  Blackhawks    Senators  Not once have I heard from the LA Kings  But ever since they started their play off run they started to get insanely popular and once they won the championship apparently everyone was a King fan   So I was just curious from NHL fans that I am correct to some degree how everyone is jumping the LA Kings bandwagon  I been to bars with people wearing their jerseys and my FB feed are  fans  praising the Kings  while before      this was pretty non existent ,Are the LA King fans the ultimate bandwagon fans ,nhl
480,This topic has been bothering me for a while  My firm belief is that Emrick is a terrible annoucer  He misidentifies who has the puck constantly and it drives me insane  He gets very theatrical when there is a big opportunity play which is understandable  But he is too over the top for my liking  I understand why NBCSN NBC employs him  The fringe fans will hear his screetching and get hooked on the game  But there are so many better announcers  Dave Strader is pretty good  but seems like he is asleep during most of the broadcast  I personally like Kenny Albert  He gives a nice presentation of the game  without treating the viewer like it s their first time watching hockey  Also Pierre McGuire is the creepiest man in the world  ,Does anyone really think Doc Emrick is a good play by play announcer ,nhl
481,Ok so the official is one of the best in the league  how d be blow it  After all  all Saad did was get tackled and held on   Yeah if you pay attention to just that interaction  it s a silly call to make  but there was a lot of funny business in the neutral zone in the five seconds leading up  including a hook that could have been called that set up the scoring chance    I imagine what happened was the rear official saw what he thought was a hook  saw both teams scrapping along the benches  and decided to settle down the powder keg along the benches there    Could he have pocketed his whistle  Yeah  but once he decided to blow his whistle  he would have been a chicken ish ref to change his mind just because somebody happened to score on the play    If you disagree with me  I understand  But you should know  Mike Milbury agrees with you  ,Defense of  rd period call  you know which one ,nhl

276,Hey everyone  I m quite new to being a hockey fan and went to a few games this season  Florida Panthers     When it comes to a fight starting everyone  the paying fans  seem to go nuts  Most of the times refs break it up and other times they let them go  How do they decide when this happens  If the fans love fighting so much why not let it happen more often  Sometimes after a fight the player or players get      or    minute penalties  this seems to discourage fighting  but why if the fans love it so much  I also don t understand how they can get so minutes  I do understand there should be a penalty for fighting but why not just make it   minutes like the rest   I ve heard many people say that the role of the  enforcer  is dead in hockey  What does this mean  If true why did the NHL get rid of them ,New hockey fan here with some questions about fighting and  enforcers  ,nhl

316,I watch a lot of puck  the one thing I won t take into account is minor league talent   I don t pay much attention to AHL Junior prospects outside my own team  Vancouver    With that being said  let s see how the teams did  feel free to hate if you don t like what I ve said     Montreal    B   I think you have to say Montreal had a good year  they ve won their division by   point  contingent on tomorrow s game   This team is solid from the back end   With a healthy Markov and Diaz it s a team that can really rotate the puck and punish teams on the PP   If Price can keep his wits about him  it s a team that can win at least   round in the post season   The size up front is an issue for sure     Boston     B    I can t grade the Bruins any higher because they didn t win the division yet   You lose a    goalie in Thomas and still put up at least    wins in a    game season   This is still the same team that won the cup   years ago   As a Canuck fan it s my duty to hate the Bruins  but there s no denying this team can ABSOLUTELY contend for a cup again this season   Their biggest weakness  I d probably say the play of Lucic  this is a local guy here in Vancouver and a beast on the ice  but he just hasn t been up to par this season     Toronto    A  Let s be real here  anyone who can t give Toronto an A wasn t paying attention   I predicted this team to make the playoffs   years ago  it didn t happen  I thought they took a step back   What a leap forward this year   I think the Leafs greatly benefited from the short season and not having enough time to implode   Great seasons from Kessel   Reimer and Scrivens  breakout performances Kadri and Bozak  and solid role players like Fraser  Orr  Kostka  sp     There s no doubt this team has over achieved this season   Their biggest weakness comes in the form of youth and inexperience   They are wildly inconsistent   This team has a great chance to win a round  but likely go up in flames after that     Ottawa    A  Can anyone dispute this   Bryan Murray lisp and all said how confident he was in this group when Spezza and Karlsson went down with long term injuries   If I recall  Anderson had just gone down as well   Anyone ever heard of Greening  Gryba  Methot  Regin  Smith  Wiercioch   the list goes on   This is a team that s bought in   Right now there s no coach that gets more from less than the moustachiod one himself   This team s potential seems to lay in the back end as well  if Anderson stands on his head  which he has for years  and the D clears away  nd chances  the Sens will beat you       Alfy has MAYBE   more kick at the can here  and don t be surprised if you see the Sens in the conference finals   Their biggest weakness  has to be the inability to score   I love the addition of Conacher  but if the Sens are gonna beat you  it s probably because you spent too much time in the box     Buffalo    C   In a division where     make the playoffs  this is a disaster for Buffalo   Hodgson had a good year and Vanek started like a house of fire   Beyond that  can you name anyone who had an outstanding year for BUF   Miller was his usual up and down self   This is a guy who can win a cup  a goal medal and shut out every team in the league   on the right night   The next night  he get s no help  and looks like a bit of a deer in the headlights when it s     after the first   Sabres were smart to unload the Robyn Regehr deal  we ll see what happens with Miller in the offseason  but this is a team that needs lots of work   I think their biggest need is secondary scoring beyond Vanek     Washington    B  This is a good team in a bad division   I projected the Caps to win the Southeast  but it wasn t easy   This team is very different when Ovie is Ovie   This guy started slow then he finished with    goals in    games in April and that was really the catalyst for this team to take the div   Despite having to deal Eakin  the Ribeiro move has to be looked at like a win in the short term with    points   Holtby was a bit up and down but ultimately this team s biggest weakness is inconsistency   When Green Ovechkin Backstrom are good  this team will beat you       it might be          or     but they ll beat you   Shut down those guys and the Caps have great role players with Brouwer and Chimera but they ll likely fall if you can put up   goals       Winnipeg    B   Feels like an F  just because they got so close   But if you REALLY look at this team  it was held together by duct tape and bandaids   Kane had a subpar season with    points in    games  to be the Evander that we know in Vancouver  he s gotta be close to   PPG   It s a big drop off after Buff  Antropov     Clitsome     Wellwood     Enstrom    struggled to stay healthy again   This is a team that unfortunately will struggle to find free agents   Pavelec again was a Vezina candidate some nights and the goat the next   Their biggest need is depth  this team can t win if Kyle Wellwood is your  nd line C  lord knows I love ole Smellwood  but he s a role player   Undoubtedly this team will benefit from realignment playing closer to home   Their draft position is unfortunate  and I think Noel deserves another season with what he s done but we ll see     Carolina    C  It has to be said that this team disappointed   Lots of pundits out there projected this team to really contend this year   Semin was added to provide  ndary scoring  brought in J  Staal as your  nd C and the top   lines looked rock solid   Canes have always had solid role guys too   But when Ward went down  the wheels kinda fell off   You gotta feel bad for a team who loses their    G  then shortly after loses their    G  and Justin Peters becomes the defacto starter   This team is weak on the backend  but ultimately  this aberration of a season could work out nicely for the  Canes with a decent draft pick and a long off season to heal     Tampa Bay    C    It s hard to give a grade to a team that finishes outside the playoffs but has the players     in the scoring race   Marty St  Louis is one helluva player  dude is    and wins a scoring title   Short season or not this dude was nothing short of amazeballs   Oh yeah  that kid Stammer is pretty good too   They fired Boucher  got a good look at some young guys in Panik and Killorn  some solid role players with guys like Tyrell too  I think this team was a victim of aging D men in Salo and Ohlund  hurt all year  and sub par goaltending from Lindback who I thought they threw into the fire too early   Their problems are not solved with Bishop folks  anyone who thinks THIS guy is the savior  is nuts imo   To really really right the ship  this team needs to unload Lecavalier and St  Louis and move into the future with Stamkos and really find some guys to play with him     Florida    D  I think I d like to give FLA an F just based on last season   This is a team who had a fucked up offseason in           and somehow made the playoffs  winning the division too   Honestly  they looked awesome vs the eventual finalists in NJ also   This season  what an implosion   They were really handicapped with injuries I must admit   The biggest pain though was their inability to trade assets   Weiss will likely walk as a UFA and it s hard to say that Markstrom is ready for NHL    duty   I still like the Clam as a     but this team has a lot of offseason work to do   Their biggest deficiency probably lies in the age of their group     Pittsburgh    A  Can anyone dispute this   This team had    points in a    game season went     in their last     had a     game winning streak if I m not mistaken   Injuries to Crosby  Neal  Malkin  Letang and Martin   I m sure I m missing some   I ll just give Ray Shero GM of the year right now   This guy has serious balls   Gets Iginla for a bag of pucks  to be honest I ve never heard of the guys he dealt and it doesn t sound like they re anything too amazing   He gets Morrow to fit a NEED  Morrow isn t a    goal scorer  but you know what  dude is a gold medal winner   He s a guy that KNOWS what he has to do and if there s   move that defines this season for Pit  I think it s that one   This team is poised for a cup run if Crosby s jaw can get right   Their biggest weakness is probably Fleury   He s amazingly inconsistent   This coming from a guy who took him as his goalie in his hockey pool lol     Rangers    B   It s hard to grade the Rags this year   They made the playoffs sure  but  with the talent this team possess it s hard to imagine how they ever have problems scoring   I love the Gaborik deal for both sides but it s unlikely Dorsett plays for NYR this season and he d help them greatly in the post season   I think the Rangers matchup fairly well with WSH  but ultimately I think the depth the Caps have punt the Rags in the first round   This isn t the    Rangers anymore  this team needs to learn to hang on to picks and young players   They re working on it   Their biggest weakness is probably inability to finish   Richards  Nash and co really have to score     a night to give themselves a chance  it can t just be King Henrik     Islanders    A   Come on  the only people who don t like seeing the Isles make the playoffs are Rangers or Devils fans   This is a team who has struggled for YEARSSSSS and hasn t made the dance since what         Nabokov  didn t wanna report  he does  has an MVP type year          when was the last time an Isles goalie did that   As a    year old no less   This team is built on youthful exuberance   That said  throw in Visnovsky who also didn t wanna report  and you ve got a pretty damn good powerplay   This team is gonna go up against Montreal and to all Habs fans that think this ll be a walk in the park  think again  the soon to be Brooklyn Islanders went        on the road   far better than their home form   Folks  this is gonna be a good one   Their biggest weakness  maybe Nabby s playoff record   Maybe their inexperience   I think there s something to be said for youthful ignorance though   Tavares is a big game player  might just lift this team to win a round     Flyers    D   What happened   Flyers went from the  th seed in the east to the    seed   I get the feeling this is one of the teams who really suffered from the shortened season   The Flyers aren t this bad   Bryz isn t a goalie who will do well in a small sample size   He s a good goalie  so while Flyer fans call to buy him out  I don t think even Ed Snyder is crazy enough to cut that cheque   This is still a stacked team and while I grade them really tough this year  this is a team that can absolutely contend for their division next year without making a move   They will make some moves  but I m not too worried about the Flyers     New Jersey    F  This is the first F I m gonna give  and before I get cursed by Devils fans  let me explain   This team was a TOTAL victim of a short season   Again a solid team over    games   Lou doesn t let his team go from cup finalist to   th in the east just like that   To be honest  if I were a Devs fan  I d be upset not to get a higher pick   It s pretty clear Marty is still huge for this team and so is Kovy as they went      when he went down   This team needs scoring help   The Devils REALLY need to start looking toward the future  they re in desperate need of a good young goalie and some scoring and I think they might be able to make a deal for Markstrom from Florida letting FLA make their Luongo deal   might be a pipe dream but I think it helps all sides   This team s biggest weakness is their reliance on their stars   If they let Clarkson walk in the offseason  it ll be the biggest mistake Lou has made in years      ,Eastern Conference Report Cards,nhl

285,With the move to the   conferences it leaves even more room for teams from a strong conference getting screwed out of a playoff position while crappier teams from weak divisions make it in   One way that this could be changed and would make for a very entertaining event for fans is to do the following   Top   teams from each conference make playoff regularly   That s   team s on each side  East   West  locked into the playoffs   Then you take the next   teams in each conference and you make them play a best of   playoff series     seed in Conference A plays   seed in Conference B and vice versa for East and West  the two teams that win their best of one play another game to decide which will be ranked  th and  th   This way you could have   teams from one conference make the playoffs and it would add single elimination games that would be a big draw for even casual fans   Make it happen NHL ,How the new NHL re alignment playoffs should be decided ,nhl

291,This is my first time ever using Gamecenter Live  and after i figured out how to get around the blackouts  i fell in love  However one thing that drives me crazy is that the streaming almost always stops within    seconds of the game end  Sometimes it is immediatly following the clock hitting       before the announcers can even announce the win themselves  It feels so abrupt and odd  I am not saying show a post game show or anything but at the least i would love to watch the Top   stars announced and i think the stream can go on a little bit longer  Does this annoy anyone else ,Why does NHL Gamecenter Live stop streaming so quickly after a game ,nhl

328,My vision of a      NHL  Would this radically realigned and expanded NHL make people a little happier than the one that is being pushed by the league now  Though in separate conferences  Detroit and Chicago would play each other only one home and home less then their in conference opponents    thanks to what I call  Non Conference Rivalry Pairs   The Rivalry Pairings are only a first pass  and could be reshuffled by people smarter than me  but I think it s a decent compromise  Thoughts    ,Oh  You Want a RADICAL Realignment ,nhl

347,Everyone seems to bag on the Western Conference  but It seems like both conferences have good and bad teams and there is no clear best Conference    I feel like everyone is propping up the East with delusions of how great some of the teams  I concede that Montreal  Senators  Penguins  Devils  and Bruins are great teams  Why does everyone keep telling me the Rangers are an elite team this season    When you look at the divisions in each conference the break down is pretty much the same   The Central is like the Northeast  where most of this division is going to make the play offs  The Pacific is like the Atlantic  where the leader is dominant  but the second seeded team was in the Stanley Cup last year  Finally  you have the crap of the league   It s clear the Northwest and the Southeast and the weak links in their respective conference  The difference is Vancouver is actually a strong hockey team and there isn t one in the Southeast ,Can We Have Some Honest Discussion about the Eastern Conference ,nhl

434,What I was curious about was what the current NHL standings would look like if the league went to a       format    points for a regulation win    points for an OT SO win  and   point for an OT SO loss  There are some differences but in my opinion this is the optimal format  No games earn more points  they all have   its just a matter of how they are distributed  As well the tie breaker I m using for this is first wins followed by OT SO wins followed by goals scored      Eastern Conference       Montreal                points        Pittsburgh                points        Carolina                points        Boston                points        Toronto                points        Ottawa               points        New Jersey               points        Philadelphia                 points                                                Winnipeg Jets                points          New York Rangers               points         Tampa Bay                points          Buffalo                points          New York Islanders                points          Washington Capitals                points          Florida Panthers                points         Western Conference       Chicago Blackhawks                points        Anaheim Ducks                points        Vancouver Canucks               points        Dallas Stars               points        Detroit Red Wings               points        Los Angeles Kings               points         St  Louis Blues               points        Minnesota Wild               points                                               San Jose Sharks               points         Phoenix Coyotes               points         Calgary Flames               points          Nashville Predators               points          Colorado Avalanche               points          Edmonton Oilers               points          Columbus Blue Jackets                points       As you can see the Eastern Conference looks basically the exact same outside of some minor changes  Zero teams that are not currently playoff teams would be bumped up  The biggest difference being Tampa Bay and the Islanders switching places at    and     Its the Western Conference that has the much larger differences namely the Los Angeles Kings moving from   th to  th  I feel like if this change was made that you d see teams battling so much towards the end of games because you do not want that other team to pick up   and you to walk away with    If you can get it into OT awesome you got a point atleast  just like it currently is   TL DR Wins games in    min not in    ,Current Standings With   Point Regulation Win,nhl

333,Ok so I just wanted to see how people felt about the           NY Rangers team  We are       right now  Here are my thoughts   DEFENSE  Our defense has been horrible  We re all over the place  The defensive structure we saw last year is not being executed  Do we need more time  I don t see why we should the defense has been unchanged  Never the less  new season new chemistry  i ll give them a little more time to get it right  But I feel like this has been our main issue    I have a real concern with Staal  Last year when he came back  he just wasn t the same  and what I ve seen from him this season is much of the same  Maybe it s still too early to say but for some reason I don t think he s ever going to be what he was again  a first line All Star  Hope I am wrong though  I still think he will be solid for years to come just not the same   I have been impressed with Stralman  I don t think this will last but either way  good for him   What is Bickel doing on the starting lineup  I get it he s big but good god lets not forget these people have to play defense on ice  I don t mind him on our bench as he s versatile backup but I really don t want him to start unless were injury plagued   Everyone else  Girardi  McDonagh and MDZ  have been okay  but they all needs to bring it up a level and get back to our system   GOALIE  Our goalie situation is unchanged and honestly no one in their right mind would have anything bad to say about this duo    Hank had a bad game last night and personally in a shortened season  after a loss  and with high expectations  Torts should have maybe thought about starting Biron much like Pit started Vokoun  Either way  no worries here     We do need to start thinking about a young goaltender who can take over for Hank in the next     years  I already lament a Hank less Rangers team  but it will happen and I think it would be wise to prepare ourselves sooner rather than later    OFFENSE  Rick Nash   What a great pick up  He has been our best player out there  holding on to pucks  skating well  shooting the puck when he can  If he can continue his play I see him being a big difference maker  I was really impressed with his answer in an interview about his first rangers goal  He said the only way that goal is important to him is if it helped them win the game  This guy gets it    Cant wait to see more of him   Richards   Has played well with   points the most on the team  No concern there   Gaborik   I love Gaborik  but he looks so scared out there  I think he knows he s too fragile to play out there and that really restrains his capability  The problem is Gaborik is getting older  when your young and not that beefy  its okay  you can take punishment  Gaborik can t do that anymore  One big hit and he s out for the season  Never the less he has one of the best shots in hockey so he ll put up points  I just hate how afraid he looks and can t help feel like his time might come soon    Stepan   Starting where he left off last season with   assist  I hope he can develop into       point scorer  Obviously not this year in a short season  but down the road  He had    points last year and I see him getting better still   Hagelin   We ll see how this pans out  I like having speed on a team  which we don t have much of  so I like his presence  however he needs to play defense first offense second  If he is going to be on a top line he needs to be that defensive forward he was last year taking pucks getting in the passing lanes  Offensively he s nothing special  so he doesn t really have any business being on the top   however if he can use his speed to take pucks and feed Gabby or Nash or whomever I m on board   Kreider  First full season  I have no expectations  If he wants to stay on the team he needs to create some chances with his speed while maintaining his defensive responsibilities  He already has a     granted so do others but again  he especially needs to watch it being the youngster   Callahan   Right back to blocking shots and getting the scoring done  What an amazing captain and his passion is always appreciated  I hope he can rally everyone together to become a well oiled machine like last year   Rupp and Boyle  No problems here if they play their defense correctly  and Boyle will chip in a few points along the way   I wasn t expecting much from recently added players as I just haven t seen enough of them to fully evaluate their play  barring Nash     I can get on board with Pyatt  he seems to replace Feds but with more scoring capability from what I have seen   Asham will never replace Prust  I think we made a mistake letting Prust go  He had a lot of heart and soul  I just hope Asham can give us something  and I don t just mean fighting  Prust did so much for the team  giving his all every shift and killing PK s  I don t know if we will see that from Asham as I just don t know him well enough   Halpern was brought in for faceoffs  I think he has yet to prove himself but all around he s been ok  and to some extent the best on his line in the last game   The overall feeling I get from the offense though is that hey aren t a unit yet  The heart and passions seems to not be there  Hopefully Torts and Cally can get the team pumped because I just don t see it like I did last year  Everyone expects us to be so good and I think affecting our mentality  All in all I am not worried  but I think we need to raise the level of competition  Get our identity back from last year   To summarize  once our defense is structurally sound  and our level of intensity comes back  we will be fine  I think we will make it to the playoffs but as  th   th seed as I think Pittsburgh will take the division title  From there anything can happen  On paper we are good enough to win the cup  its all about how we work together and how hard we play   Thoughts   Edit  Thanks everyone for the great comments and like most of you I think we can turn this around  LGR,Early NYR Analysis ,nhl
