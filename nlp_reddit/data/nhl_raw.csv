0,My die hard hockey friends and I are going to be in Dublin for Game 7! Where could we watch the game!,,nhl,1560207847,Drugspider,7,1,True,2019-06-10
1,What's 'dirty?' [Serious],"Discussing the SCF, can't seem to get past the team-partisanship (I'm a Bruins fan, full disclosure) so I thought I'd post thoughts about levels of ""dirty"" play in hockey, and see what others thought.

Source: Am former goalie through HS; a close family member is AHL player; I've been watching NHL since the early 70's.  As always YMMV.

I think there are definite levels of hockey play.

CLEAN hockey.  No need for detail here.  Looks a lot like Olympic hockey; checking and stickwork is light and mostly polite.

PHYSICAL hockey.  Lots of checking; no careless stickwork, no blindside hits, no post-whistle shots.

CHIPPY hockey.  Physical hockey but lots of extra finish on checks, less-than-pious stickwork, post-whistle wrassling and pawing.

DIRTY hockey.  Say, stomping on a guy's stick blade during the faceoff.  Or, say, whacking a guy's exposed wrist with your stick during the faceoff.  Punching a guy while he's down in a front-of-the-net tangle.  (Trying to show I'm not at all partisan here; those who have been watching know what I'm referring to).

HEADHUNTING.  Boarding a guy face first.  High elbows at full speed.  Knee on knee.  Etc.

IMHO I can, to an extent, 'accept' all of those except the head hunting.  That's what penalties are for, etc.  And the classic ""enforcer"" is usually a combo of dirty and chippy - meting out a weird flavor of frontier justice that tends to normalize over time.

Most importantly, there are a LOT of players who engage in these types of hockey over time.  You don't label a player for one event, you do it for a pattern.

So, even though most Bruins fans would label Nazr Kadry a headhunter, I don't at all.  I think he's a CHIPPY/DIRTY player who had a bad night in Round 1.

Similarly, I don't look at the Blues roster and think ""those are all headhunters.""  

OTOH, the pattern has been weirdly consistent and specific this series, so one wonders.

Anyhow, those are my thoughts on the differentiation between types of play and possible labels.

Love to hear what others think.",nhl,1560208435,bedroom_fascist,4,8,True,2019-06-10

9,"HARDCORE NHL FANS. If you can add any player you want to your current team, who would you want and why?","Im an oilers fan and we need a bit of everything. But having McDavid already, getting 1 more super star would solve alot of problems.
KUCHEROV imo would do just that.
Also im assuming were going to sign filppula as rumored. Hes from final finland so there hoping he could rejuvenate his country men in puljuarvvi.

As good as this team looks. I see us as a playoff team and nothing else. Maybe im wrong. Maybe we would win the cup with this exact team..but theres some teams out there like the sharks who have 4 lines that can score. Blues Bruins vegas caps leafs blue jackets lightning same thing also. Got 3 solid lines that can score any given night. This is exactly what the oilers lineup would look like minus the lines switched around maybe with 2-3 guys only. Other then that would be nice wouldnt it.

25,An open letter from a Blues fan to Bruins fans.,"First and foremost, I would like to say congratulations on getting this far. Let’s be honest, with over 30 teams in the NHL it takes more than just luck to make it to the finals to win the hardest trophy in sports to earn.  So the fact that both of the teams in the finals are here speaks to the talent that they both possess. 

Secondly, I can’t tell you how much I’ve appreciated the creative shit talking going back and forth between the two fan bases. It’s been creative, funny, oddly weird, and just down right awful. All of the things that make for an engaged fan base to actively participate. Ive been just as guilty as most do not pointing fingere at which side is worse. 

Lastly, I truly would like to wish you luck for tomorrow nights game. I will be pushing hard for the Blues to win, After the game I will not be talking shit win, lose, or draw but until then, go fuck yourselves Bruins. May the better team win. 

Sincerely,
A single Blues fan.

38,I’m hoping for mass reffing chaos in tonight’s Game 7 Final; a reffing story:,"
-Blues are down by four with three minutes left

-O’Reilly falls awkwardly after losing a face off and Marchand gets a five minute major - Marchand was not on the ice during the play.

-Blues score five quick goals

-Down by one; the Bruins make a last second push and score from a hand pass; to force OT‬

-First OT solves nothing and no penalties are called despite 14 pucks going over the glass; refs claim they saw nothing. Chara’s jaw hangs by a thread after multiple high sticks.

-Second OT; Blues come down on a 2 on 1; a stick is thrown from the bench; no call; one of them are ten feet offside; they sweep the leg of the defender; crash the net smashing Rask out of the crease; while Berube leaps from bench onto ice and kicks winning goal into back of net. Refs saw nothing.

286,"Superfan Anderson, 11, part of Blues' celebration","BOSTON -- Laila Anderson is only 11 years old, but she swears she has a gift: She can always predict who is going to score the first goal for her beloved St. Louis Blues.

Before Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Final on Wednesday, Anderson told her mother it was going to be Ryan O'Reilly.

ADVERTISEMENT

""My mom was like, 'It's not going to happen,'"" Laila said. That got her extra fired up.

""I said, 'There's two things you just said wrong,'"" she recalled. ""First, you don't doubt ROR. And you don't doubt me.""

""Mom,"" she said standing on the ice at TD Garden grinning after the Blues won their first Stanley Cup and O'Reilly -- after scoring the game's opening goal -- won the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP. ""I called it.""

EDITOR'S PICKS

Blues' O'Reilly scores again, wins Conn Smythe

Blues lean on 'cool customer' Binnington in G7 win
Laila, who is battling a life-threatening autoimmune disease, isn't just a Blues super fan, she's the team's good-luck charm. So much so that the Blues flew her and her mother to Boston for Game 7, and then invited them on the ice to celebrate with the team.

Defenseman &lt;a href=""https://www.sportsfinalsgear.com/Blues-Colton-Parayko-Jersey""&gt;Colton Parayko&lt;/a&gt;, after hoisting the Cup himself, knelt onto the ice to meet Laila. She wiped away tears, and then held on and kissed the trophy. Pat Maroon, a St. Louis native, lit up when he saw Laila in the crowd. ""Laila!"" he shouted. ""We did it, princess!"" Then the two posed for a photo.

Anderson has hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a disease only 15 other children in the world have been diagnosed with. Her love of the Blues, she said, was one of the things that helped her through treatments and recovery. Many Blues players got to know Laila through team-sponsored visits at the hospital, and she formed an especially strong connection with Parayko and Alex Steen.

""We get to show up to the rink and be with the guys, do things like that. But you go to the hospital, and you speak with her, and you watch her go through all that stuff. I can't imagine what she's going through. What kinds of things they're putting in her body to try and help her recover,"" Parayko told ESPN before the Stanley Cup Final began. ""She continues to have a strong attitude. A positive attitude. It's so special. We might lose a hockey game, and we're frustrated or go home really upset. But there are people out there trying to battle for their lives.""

Laila's condition has limited her travel significantly. She had a bone marrow transplant in January that meant she could only go between the hospital and her house.

Then, before Game 3 of the Western Conference finals, Laila's doctors cleared her to attend. Anderson's mom, Heather, broke the news in a video, which went viral. Laila then attended Games 4 and 6, and returned to the Enterprise Center when the Blues reached the Stanley Cup Final.

Then before Game 7, Heather Anderson met with her daughter again and pressed record on her phone.

""If you could watch the game, anywhere in the world tomorrow -- anywhere in the world -- where would you watch your boys play tomorrow?"" her mom asked.

""Boston,"" Laila said, without pause.

""What if I told you the Blues called, and they want you at the game?"" her mom asked.

Blues superfan Laila celebrates Cup win with Parayko11-year-old Blues fan Laila Anderson hugs Colton Parayko on the ice after St. Lous wins the Stanley Cup.
Laila looked at her mom: ""What? How?""

""The doctor said it's OK,"" her mom said.

Then Laila could barely contain her tears.

""No he didn't, Mommy, no he didn't,"" she said breaking down, collapsing into her mom's shoulder.

""That video last night her mom posted was truly amazing,"" Maroon said Wednesday morning. ""She's been an inspiration to all of us throughout the year and Alex Steen has done a good job of bringing her and making her feel comfortable, Colton Parayko the same way, making her feel welcome to the team and the St. Louis Blues welcome her and her family. It's been truly amazing. She's a fighter and she's going to continue to fight. She's our inspiration. We look up to her, what she has to go through every single day. To get on that plane, I know the doctors are questionable of getting her out there because of her health and to say that she gets to come on the plane and travel out here to see us play, that's truly amazing. I'm so happy for her.""


When asked if Laila gave the team any pointers, Maroon said: ""She gives us enough, just the way she fights. Go out there and fight for her. What she has to go through every single day.""

On the ice, Laila -- wearing a jean jacket and a Blues championship cap -- was as popular as any St. Louis player. She did several media scrums. Her mom stood beside her the entire time.

""Being here for this, it's everything I imagined and more,"" Laila said. ""I don't even know what to say. I love this team. I love them so much.""",nhl,1560409630,garoppoloas,2,8,True,2019-06-13

478,Kevin Hayes signs 7 year 50 million deal with the Flyers. I play devil's advocate on the criticism for free.,"In my opinion, that's a fair contract for Kevin Hayes right now, and 3 years from now when the cap goes higher, it will be a steal. He is maybe the only 6'5 forward in the entire NHL besides Laine who can skate and play well enough to keep up with the modern NHL. He's not super fast but he's not slow. Above average speed, great size, high skill level, great vision. His long reach eats up many passing lanes defensively. I'd be interested for more in depth advanced stats info, but his corsi relative has been way in the positive for three years in a row. I think he produced at a 60+ point pace per 82 games his past two seasons, making him an excellent 2nd line center at worst.

He's not flashy, but there's something Mark Stone and Ryan O'Reillyish about his game. He might not hit as much as them but he knows how to use his body to protect the puck and make plays and that's more important.

I always thought Hayes might be one of the best values in free agency in terms of his age, being in his prime, and the fact he was undervalued and would get signed for 6 per year instead of 8 to 10. Well, 7 is a little closer to being too high, but I think, as I said in the title, that's fair value right now, and will be great value in the future. He also brings much needed size to the Flyers forward group. Giroux and TK are skilled, but lack size. Voracek has some size but nothing like Hayes. Couterier has a bit of size but nothing like Hayes and I don't think he's as fast as Hayes either.

If Giroux plays wing, Hayes is the Flyers clear #2 center. If Giroux plays center, Hayes can be a dominant 3C and get PP time. In any case, he is an excellent player, one of the most underrated players in the NHL, and the Flyers are getting him in his prime on a fair contract for no assets in return.

45,NHL n00b/bandwagon fan here... I was wondering how the names being engraved on the Stanley Cup works?,"Like the title says, I'm not much of an NHL historian, or even really a fan of the regular season.  I love watching highlights, but I guess it just ""isn't my sport"" the way the NFL is, where I will watch a game that has absolutely nothing to do with my team.

Playoff hockey is probably the most exciting playoffs in all of the major sports, and when the Bruins make it this far I definitely watch.

All that being said, please don't chastise me for this elementary question... but how exactly does the Stanley Cup work with the names being engraved?

If you win a cup, how long is your name going to be on the cup?  It doesn't seem to be gaining more and more ""rows"", so how do they decide what gets cut out every year when there is a new winner?  are the names engraved on plates, so every year the team that won X years ago is just completely removed, or is there more finesse to it?

126,Blues fan honest take on game 3: a hard played game on both ends of the ice. Both teams deserve credit for playing hard playoff hockey.,"Both teams played hard and well. Mistakes were made on both ends. Bad calls were made:

Perron throwing puck out of play which 
should have been a penalty for delay of game. He continues to get two goals. No call on this undoubtedly changed the game.

Hand pass call missed and ends the game. In a perfectly called game, the hand pass stops the play and who knows how the game would have gone from there. 

There’s plenty of pressure for officials to make calls perfectly all game - and quite frankly, losing that way stings, but it shouldn’t take away from the way either team played. 

Congrats to Jumbo for finding his groove tonight and putting up some goals. 

Also glad to see tarasenko get back into the scoring and see Perron get a couple goals. 

Bad calls went both ways, and they probably always will unless video review rules are changed. It is what it is though, and despite losing, both teams deserve credit for the way they played. 

Great series so far, and if you guys come out on top, I’ll be a bandwagon fan for you guys without doubt to get the cup.

141,"When Pavelski got injured vs Vegas on his flop-gone-wrong, no ref called a penalty, but they huddled &amp; the linesman made one up. Why couldn't they do the same with the handpass?","I know hand passes are not reviewable with video. Neither are crosschecking penalties. Yet in game 7 vs Vegas, Pavelski won a faceoff, got pushed in the chest, and flopped his head back like as a Ducks fan I've seen him do hundreds of times before especially in the playoffs to try to draw a penalty, right as another Vegas player was skating behind him, and this caused him to lose his balance and fall on his head. No ref had a penalty call during the run of play, but after the whistle was blown, they huddled with the linesman, and the linesman said he saw a stick hit Pavelski in the face, something that was completely made up, specifically it seems, we can now say with 20-20 hindsight, to try to the Sharks go deep in the playoffs, so why wasn't the same done in this instance?

It also calls into question, if it's illegal to get information from Toronto, from video review, to overturn a call, but it's legal to get information from the linesman to overturn a call, why is that sometimes the refs go to the linesman first, but sometimes they go to the video review first? It would seem that when they want a call overturned, they can choose to go to the linesman first, and say ""we overturned it legally,"" but when they want the call to stand, they can go straight to the video judge, hear the truth of what happened from him first, so then they can say, ""yeah it was a handpass, but I got that info from the video review first, not from the linesman, so I can't overturn it.""

Y’all know better, hockey is a very fast paced game, and believe it or not, even 4 officials on the ice can miss a call. And more importantly, sometimes you benefit from blown calls, and sometimes you don’t. Quid pro quo; it’s a part of the game.

Blues had the win in the 3rd period but allowed a game-tying goal. They shouldn’t have let it go to OT. Refs call a generous 5-minute major instead of the usual 2-minute minor? No big deal, but they didn’t exactly hand over those 4 goals that Vegas allowed. Even for a 5-minute major, that’s a lot of goals to give up in 5 short-handed minutes.

Before that, I think Edmonton needed a new stadium, but the organization was floundering for almost an entire decade, and then they get Mcdavid.

Leafs were floundering for years, they get Austin Matthews.

When's the last time a small market team jumped to the #1 overall pick? Or got lots of calls to go their way to win even one playoff series, let alone 2 going on 3 like the Sharks now?

And just look how the Sharks were built. Boston basically gives them Joe Thornton without apparently even offering him to the rest of the league. Brent Burns traded to them for pennies on the dollar. Erik Karlsson traded to them for, yet again, not a single premier asset back. And many of these GMs who make supposedly ""stupid"" trades get hired back to run another team a few years later, like a revolving door. Almost like there are too many players to control and keep quiet, so the ""fixing"" is done at the GM level, and the referee level, where only a few dozen people have to keep their mouths shut, not thousands of players.

They must have not been watching.

You can clearly see that none of the 3 high officials would’ve seen it due to the guys body being between them and the puck when he hand passed.  The low official due to his positioning was looking through the net and the goalie. There is no way any of the 3 high officials would’ve made that call due to an obstructed view because if they were wrong when the play seemed to be right in front of the low guy and he didn’t call it, they’d be burned alive. 

This based on sight-lines was probably only the low officials call. And he blocked himself out on positioning. The cameras had better angles so obviously we can watch and see it but I don’t think anyone with the refs view could’ve seen it and comfortably made that call. It’s unfortunate that it cost the Blues in such a big moment but if anything blame positioning not the refs not watching the play or being corrupt.",nhl,1558017465,Chefy10,2,6,True,2019-05-16

It’s true that review does solve some issues just about perfectly. Did the goal cross the line? Works. But rarely is it that tidy. 

Start with ridiculous offside review. Don’t even need to elaborate.  Then there’s goaltender interference. Like that’s EVER going to be definitive. And how about those 3 minute delays. And challenges to the challenges.

IMHO suckiest part is that the presence of replay creates an unfair expectation that everything will end up perfect. Of course it won’t. Refs miss lots of calls in every game. Mind you, not as big as this obvious hand pass, but you get the drift.

Plenty of years at the top of the conference, plenty of years being the favorite, even choking after winning the presidents cup years ago.  They’ve always been on the wrong side of history. Sorry Vancouver (you definitely have had it worse) 

I’ve hoped and prayed for breaks and lucky bounces over all these years, but now, having been on the right side of so many controversial plays, it feels a little icky. I’m happy that my team is having success, and they still aren’t even close to reaching the promise-land.

 I’m curious to reach out to you fans, and ask you to recall times in which your team was on the right side of a bad call (s) and reminisce on the time and how it impacted the way you felt. Ultimately I’m a fan, I’m going to root for my team. It’s not the players fault that these refs have made these calls, but obviously as players, they all play a part in the process.

300,Ending the Sharks vs. Blues Hand Pass Debate Once And For All... With Science!,"You’ve all seen the clip. Game 5, Sharks pull a hand pass to get the game-winning goal, hand pass wasn’t called or even reviewed. Now I see lots of people arguing that it wasn’t directed at a player. I am here to disprove that with nothing more than human anatomy.

The NHL clearly states that batting the puck with your hand is fine, as long as it is batted onto the ice. The only time a hand pass is legal is in a team’s defensive zone. Just in case you also didn’t know, closing your fingers on a puck is illegal in all circumstances unless you are a goalie. Now that we’ve established the rulebook’s definition of a hand pass, let’s get to anatomy.

On the play, Meier swats the puck out of the air while on the ground in an attempt to prevent a Blues’ possession. Or did he? Do something for me very quickly. Let your arms rest at your side. Then bring them forward the way Meier did. Notice something? Your palms always face inward unless you make an effort to have them face a different direction. That’s where we see the issue with the play.

Look at Meier’s palm during the hand pass. It’s not facing inward, it’s facing parallel to his arms, straight forward. This means there had to have been a reason as to why he would change the position of his hand. That reason is most likely him going for a hand pass. The reason he faced his palm directly in front of him was that Karlsson was also directly in front of him. If he moved his hand to face Karlsson, the puck would begin to move towards Karlsson. And that’s exactly what happened.

After Meier bats the puck, Nyquist intercepts the pass and passes it to Karlsson. Karlsson goes on to win the game, there’s no review of the goal, and San Jose gets their 3rd questionable victory in 3 playoff series.

Now here’s the question everyone asked: Should it have been counted? My answer, no. I do have a bit of bias as a Blues fan, but since my bias is backed up by human anatomy, I’d say I’m more likely to be right than wrong in this situation. While some may argue it isn’t allowed to be reviewed, I’d say that rule is pretty unclear as it stands. Not only was an offsides reviewed to give San Jose a division series win while a hand pass to give them a 2-1 lead wasn’t, but the rule’s don’t state the exact circumstances that could allow for a review on a game-winning goal. Not to mention this is the playoffs and that if San Jose wins this series because of that call, it would be very suspicious given their other two series they had handed to them.

So, in conclusion, the goal never should have been counted. Human anatomy proves Meier did, in fact, direct the puck to Karlsson. Also, San Jose’s questionable playoff run doesn’t help their case about this call. My Blues bias could be a big part of this, but at the same time, I don’t research these kinds of things with bias in mind. If I did, my results would be far less conclusive than they are. I simply wanted to know if we got screwed over by the refs of if we deserved the loss, and I found we got screwed over.

If anyone else has looked into this or thinks my evidence is faulty, feel free to argue your own point in the replies. I love debate and hockey so it could be pretty fun. Like the old gumshoes shows.",nhl,1558385622,EatThatPusi445,4,0,True,2019-05-20

Sharks vs Golden Knights
 VGK are winning 3-0 in the 3rd period. 

Eakin catches Pavelski with a high stick and he’s get a 5min game misconduct for something that should have been a 4minute minor as most since blood was drawn. 

This leads to the sharks scoring 4 almost instantly and they win the series in OT. 

Fast forward to another Game 7

Sharks vs Avalanche 

MacKinnon scores a game tying goal, what could be a huge swing for the Avalanche.

Sharks for whatever reason decide to call for a review to see if the Avalanche were offside.

There wasn’t an ounce of conclusive proof to overturn the call, no angle showed any bit of conclusive proof Landeskog was offside.

But nonetheless, without any conclusive proof they still go ahead and overturn the call. 
  
Not even two minutes later, MacKinnon was blatantly tripped on a breakaway and it was ignored. If anything was deserving of a penalty shot that definitely was. 

The Avalanche were effectively screwed out of a game typing goal and penalty shot in the most important game in the series.

Game 6

Sharks vs Blues

A must win game for the Sharks and a clinching game for the Blues 


Let me first say that overtime goals being non-reviewable is irresponsible and borderline ignorant by the NHL. 

A perfect example of why that rule is wrong on so many levels is last night, another very blatant illegal play by another Sharks player. 

The referees saying that they “didn’t see” the hand-pass is just ridiculous. 

In an instant the Blues had that chance to move was just ripped away from them from irresponsible jobs on the referees part. 


I don’t know if the Sharks are just the luckiest team in the NHL or what but at every turn; crucial calls are always in their favor.

416,Proof that the NHL does not care about their image,"This has nothing to do about the referees, the on ice product, or really anything to do with their presentation. What the NHL truly does not care about, is their representation in gaming form. Yes, I'm ranting about EA sports NHL series.

Gone are the days of enjoying gm mode, the overly complicated scouting system that looks simple enough, yet is so mind numbingly bad, most players change settings back to what ""worked"" 6 years ago. Is there a franchise level prospect in the ohl? Better tell your scouts to look at him personally because they are absolutely remedial at their jobs.

Want to play as an actual up and coming youngster with aspirations to be a top NHL player? You're in luck, only if you want to play in the chl, despite having multiple European leagues and teams in the game.

Did you just finish your entry level contract and win the Stanley cup, conn Smythe, art Ross, and rocket Richard trophies multiple times? Be prepared to be offered... 2 contracts for around 2.4 million per season for 3 years.

What about the actual gameplay though? Well you're in luck playing tripping simulator 2019. If the puck is 2 inches left of your stick, press the poke check to watch your player jab his stick directly at your opponents skates, because that's defense. Hitting is a breeze too, and by that I mean you can set up a Kronwall type hit and watch as your opponent blows by you as if you were just a slight breeze in his way. Stick lifts are great as well, if you want to teach developers how to completely fuck up collision detection as your stick goes directly through your opponent's stick.

Don't have enough friends or club mates online to form a full team? That's alright the expansive artificial intelligence can give you a player that has Wayne Gretzky's offensive skills with nick Lidstrom's defense or simple jack that can't even figure out how to skate towards a loose puck when they are clearly the closest player to it. There is no in between.

Yes, all these problems are made by EA sports and their unwillingness to fix issues that have plagued their games for years, over multiple console generations. The bigger issue is the NHL allows this company to use their image, brand, and license and they put little to no effort in putting forth a decent product. The NHL is allowing EA sports to release a product that would be laughably bad, if they didn't release it yearly, at the same price as a game like red dead redemption, halo, or assassin's creed. 

It feels like a slap in the face of hockey fans that once enjoyed playing these games and shows the NHL does not care about how a company harms their image, as long as they get a nice check.

I would love to see the NHL drop EA and hire their own team of developers to make a game they can control the quality of, I just doubt Bettman cares enough about technology to make that happen (based on how awful the NHL app is on multiple platforms).",nhl,1558546891,fentown,3,4,True,2019-05-22

206,Tampa/Columbus series.,"Just to get the numbers out if the way. 

Out of 188 times in history a team has been up 3-0 in the series, only 4 times has a team ever come back and won. That equals 2.1% of the time, or roughly 1 in 49.

So that means Columbus has over a 97% chance of moving on, mathematically.

http://www.puckreport.com/2009/04/nhl-playoff-comebacks-trailing-3-0.html?m=1

Anyways...

I'm impartial on both teams here. I give Tampa credit for their season, and Columbus has never won a playoff series. So either way I'm not sore about who wins or loses. 

But I see a lot of press about how bad Tampa is doing, but not much about how well Columbus is doing. If anyone has watched the games, Columbus isn't beating Tampa on lucky shots, bad penalties, or bounces... they're just straight up beating them. Tampa hasn't really shown up to play.

There are many reasons this could be, but I'd like to say Columbus is doing really well. Their not cheesing their way through this serious on luck and bad bounces.

I know there are waves of salty Tampa fans, which I get. But be salty at your own team, don't take it out on other fans. I mean.. ofcourse defend yourself. But some fans are just rampaging over others for no reason. It's not other peoples fault Tampa is self destructing. Stamkos is doing nothing. Kucherov is having tantrums, Hedman is injured, and Vasi has been shaky at best.

To counter that Columbus is firing on all cylinders, so it's kind of a perfect storm.

Either way I'm happy. I have lots of respect for Tampa based on their season, and Columbus needs to win a playoff series.",nhl,1555382095,DestroyingAlaska,3,17,True,2019-04-15

I'm a Oilers fan,but for the past couple months I've heard countless people suggest that the playoff format needs to be changed, that the Leafs/Bruins shouldn't be meeting in the 1st round,that the 4th &amp; 5th best teams in the league shouldn't be eliminated after round 1 bc they need to face each other. So that got me thinking about the format, and I thought of a crazy yet fair format I believe, which applies to MLB,NBA and NFL.




The regular season SHOULD matter to teams and standings. So what I purpose is that you keep East &amp; West conferences, you could even keep divisions if you want, like is, and seed by overall standings, go back to 1-8 overall seeding, but here is my idea. The team who finishes 1st, gets to pick outta the remaining 7 teams, who they wanna face, and then the 2nd team decides and so on. With the higher seed always deciding who they wanna play with each round. It would create drama and place value on each position in the playoff as a reward for being a good team for a stretch of 82 games. I just think it would be pretty cool to start rivalries with teams that aren't forced upon each team based on geography, and a 30 min show like they do for the lottery would be pretty great tv for the playoff cities.",nhl,1555484177,vintagetrance,3,1,True,2019-04-17

380,How to lose the Hart Trophy in fou... three games,"I know the Hart Trophy is meant to be a regular season award, but how can you possibly give it to Kucherov with that absolutely abysmal playoff performance? The biggest knock against McDavid and Kane is that their teams didn’t make the playoffs but currently they both have the same amount of playoff wins as Kucherov had this year. Being part of the team with the greatest record in nhl history and getting swept in the first round by a wildcard team is laughable and if people hold McDavid/Kane accountable for their teams not making the playoffs, kucherov needs to be held accountable for this dumpster fire of a postseason. You put Kane or McDavid on the Lightning and they’ll put up similar or better numbers than kucherov. 

You take kucherov off the Lightning and they’re still a good team that’ll choke in the playoffs, you take mcdavid or Kane off of their respective teams and they might as well relegate themselves  to compete in the AHL.

442,The Sharks are the absolute worst in the playoffs when the other team has 3 wins in the series,"I'm ashamed to identify as a Sharks fan. Why? Because this team is the poster boy for ""gives up when things look down"". They're currently down 3-1, and based on their playoff history when the other team has 3 wins, they're gonna lose despite being at home. Even if they somehow pull out a victory, they'll lose Game 6 for sure. You can trust me as a Sharks fan and based on pure history:

2018: went down 3-2 to Vegas, got shutout the next game

2017: went down 3-2 to Edmonton, got shutout the next game

2016: went down 3-2 to Pittsburgh, scored 1 goal in a 3-1 loss the next game

2014: dropped the deciding Game 7 to Los Angeles, scoring 1 goal in a 5-1 loss

2013: dropped the deciding Game 7 to Los Angeles, scoring 1 goal in a 2-1 loss

2012: went down 3-1 to St. Louis, scored 1 goal in a 3-1 loss the next game

2011: went down 3-1 to Vancouver, blew a 2-1 lead with less than 20 seconds left and then got scored on in OT to lose

2011: yeah sure, they beat Detroit in a deciding Game 7. But just letting Detroit come back from a 3-0 deficit was depressing in itself. Real Sharks fans just knew that this didn't bode well against Vancouver, and well, they lost that series in 5 games.

2010: went down 3-0 to Chicago, blew a 2-0 lead and lost 4-2 the next game

2009: went down 3-1 to Anaheim, yeah sure they won Game 5 3-2 in OT to cut the deficit to 3-2 and then promptly scored 1 goal in a 4-1 loss the next game. Oh yeah, Anaheim was the 8th seed too.

2008: yeah sure, they rallied to win 2 games after initially being down 3-0. That didn't prevent them from losing Game 6 in 4OT. ICYMI, the Sharks were down 3-2 at that point. And they lost as they usually do in this position. Oh yeah, and in typical Sharks elimination game fashion, they scored 1 goal.

2007: went down 3-2 to Detroit, got shutout the next game

2006: went down 3-2 to Edmonton, got shutout the next game

2004: went down 3-2 to Calgary, scored 1 goal in a 3-1 loss the next game

2002: got shutout in the deciding Game 7 to Colorado

2001: went down 3-2 to St. Louis, scored 1 goal in a 2-1 loss the next game

2000: so great, the Sharks won Game 7 after nearly blowing a 3-1 lead. Guess what, the next series against Dallas, they went down 3-1 and then promptly lost the next game 4-1. ICYMI, they scored only 1 goal in the elimination game.

You'd have to go all the way back to 1995 for the only time in franchise history the Sharks came back from a 3-2 deficit to win the series. Some franchises have done that in the span of a few years!

Look, I don't need to go any further. There's a reason no one picks them to win the SC, and that's because there's no reason to. They RARELY show up in the playoffs. The amount they show up in the playoffs is inversely proportional to how desperate they should be; the more crucial the game, the less desperate they play. Just look at how many elimination games they've scored 0 or 1 goals in during this decade.

I don't even need to go into how poorly the Sharks play when they go down 0-2. They've never won a playoff series when that has happened.

I've been saying this for a long time: Thornton, Pavelski, Burns, Couture, they need to go. They're fun guys to be with, but being a fun guy doesn't win championships, and honestly, after watching them for a while now, I don't think they care enough to. They're more concerned about being fun teammates than actually winning, and it creates a losing culture in the playoffs especially since they're viewed as the team leaders. It's time to clean up the house. Get guys who actually care to perform in the playoffs instead of shrink or just don't care when under pressure. Of course, with Doug Wilson as GM, that's definitely not happening anytime soon. He needs to go too.

Oh yeah, did I say this already? Sharks lose 4-0 in Game 5 for sure. Vegas, you can punch your ticket to the next round against us yet again as a Sharks fan. To the Sharks organization, I say this: embrace the rebuild. If you ever wish to compete for a SC, you're gonna need a vastly different team than the one we have right now.",nhl,1555597986,displacedindavis,9,0,True,2019-04-18

Granted, the East was a dogfight this year and the Sharks choke big time in the playoffs, but this is still quite unusual.

What about the number 3 seeds? The Predators are currently in a dogfight with the Stars, tied 2-2. And the Capitals? Well, they've got some work to do if they wish to defend their title. The Hurricanes have come back from an 0-2 deficit and the Caps are scrambling without T.J. Oshie now. So no, the 3 seeds aren't safe either.

Fast forward to 2019. Come playoff time, this will happen in almost every game. It will also happen when the home team is STILL losing after just scoring. Most of the goals scored to spark these chants will not be the goalie's fault, yet they will still go on. 

At this point, the chanting is so prevalent that it's completely lost it's allure. It's basically a thing to do when your team scores. I can't see it affecting the goalie cause it's pretty much an extra horn going off after the goal.

45,This makes no sense,"March 15,  Toronto Maple Leafs (St. Pats) vs Philadelphia Flyers.

During the first period, with about 2.5 minutes left the leafs had strong pressure on philly. While the puck was in the corner, the philly goalie put tremendous pressure from his left skate into the goal post, effectivly taking the net off. No pressure infront of the net. The net is now slightly off and seconds later, Toronto scores.

The goal is called off because the net was off.

Anyone who has touched a nhl net knows, they are pretty fuckin solid. This goalie was NOT contacted and put the net off, on his own. For more proof, they did not repair the net peg hole, they just put the net back on (insinuating it was up to code and secure prior and after this event). It is quite clear the goalie pushed his own net off when he felt pressured and a goal was called back because of this. 

How come this is not a penalty agaisnt the goalie? This strongly implies any goalie can just kick the net off (while hugging the post, just push it off) and be safe if a goal is scored before the refs shut down the play. Even then, if there is pressure from, say, a delayed penalty call, the goalie can just kick his net off.

53,Atlantic Division Playoff Preview: 03/16,"It’s that time of the year again in the Hockey season where two points are crucial, and everyone on the team must put in a big contribution. Fans and analysts after every game look immediately to the wild card standings in every division but, specifically today were taking a look at the Atlantic Division playoff race. With the Tampa Bay Lightning clinching a playoff spot already, and most likely securing first in the division, we take a look at the Boston Bruins, Toronto Maple Leafs and the Montreal Canadiens.  

### Bruins vs. Maple Leafs

Boston vs Toronto is very likely to happen in the first round yet again, which is concerning for Maple Leafs fans as the Leafs don’t fair well with the Bruins in recent history. Boston has taken the last two series in Game 7 over the Leafs who had horrible meltdowns in TD Garden. So, the Maple Leafs this year are trying very hard to get the second place slot in the division in order to start the series at home and maybe end the series at home in a possible Game 7 scenario. Here is a quick look at both teams next 5 games on the schedule:  


**BOS:** March 14 @ Winnipeg(L), March 16 vs. Columbus, March 19 @ New York Islanders, March 21 @ New Jersey and March 23 @ Florida.

One home game, four away games. Three games vs. playoff teams, two games vs. non-playoff teams.  


**TOR:** March 13 vs. Chicago(L), March 15 vs. Philadelphia(W), March 16 @ Ottawa, March 19 @ Nashville and March 20 @ Buffalo.  

Two home games, three away games. One game vs. playoff team, four games vs. non-playoff teams.   


The schedule seems to be leaning towards the Maple Leafs but the Boston Bruins are the Boston Bruins and are a powerhouse when everyone is clicking. With less than a month left in the NHL regular season, the second place position in the Atlantic Division is still at-large.

### Montreal Canadiens

The Montreal Canadiens are currently just outside of the last wild card spot which is held by the Columbus Blue Jackets. No one thought that the Canadiens would be in the conversation of playoff hockey at the beginning of the season but, with players like Brendan Gallagher, Shea Weber, Tomas Tatar, Carey Price and so on, giving them a chance every night helps their hopes of playing playoff hockey. Montreal recently suffered bad losses to San Jose (5-2) and Anaheim (8-2) on their annual California road-trip hurts a ton when collecting key points. Their schedule ahead however might give the players and fans some hope:  


March 14 @ New York Islanders (L), March 16 vs. Chicago, March 19 @ Philadelphia, March 21 vs. New York Islanders, March 23 vs Buffalo.

Three home games, two away games. Two games vs. playoff teams, three games vs non-playoff teams.  


The one game that has to be a for sure win is against the Flyers on March 19. The Canadiens need to grab all two points in this one because the Flyers are right behind their tail in the wild card fight and could be massive to spread the gap between these two teams. The Canadiens last five games to end the regular season are going to be tough playing five high placed playoff teams. Columbus, Washington, Winnipeg, Tampa Bay and Toronto. So, if they are going to have a chance to squeak in, I strongly believe they need to win their next few games, Carey Price needs to play like 2014-15 Carey Price down the stretch and they need to generate more opportunities and goals on the power-play as they sit 31st with a power-play percentage at 12.4 percent.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*keep the 2 conferences and introduce 4 ""groups"" instead of divisions to each conference.\*\*\*

\-the top 8 teams from each conference make the playoffs regardless of what group they are in so a shitty group of teams might not have a team make the playoffs at all from their grouping.

\-but these groups would have do with regional placement and historical divisions which will keep the history and rivalries of the nhl alive and well.

\-you would play your group teams more than any other teams in the league which would be great from a historical and rivalry standpoint but no mediocre team from a shitty division would have an advantage because the group placement has nothing to do with the playoff qualifications.

\-overall this is a mix of old and new.  and ensures the top 8 teams from each conference make the playoffs.

&amp;#x200B;

for example, the east conference would look like this:

\*tri-state group: isles, rags, devs, and flys

\*canada or close enough to the border group: leafs, habs, sens, sabres

\*south-ish group: bolts, panthers, canes, caps

\*central-ish group: bruins, pens, jacks, wings

I hate that fans of non playoff bound teams want their teams to lose in order to increase their draft position.  Here’s an idea on how to incentivize winning for non playoff teams:
At the end of the season group the teams with the five worst records.  The team with the best record in the group over the final 10 games wins the first pick.  Second best gets second pick etc.  Then take the next 5 worst teams.  Same thing.  Best record in that group gets pick number 6.  Then take the remaining non playoff teams.  Same.  The team with the best record would get pick number 11.  Would that not make for some pretty damn exciting games at the end of the year between say, LA and Anaheim, or Ottawa and New Jersey?  Coaches and GMs would ice the best team possible and fans wouldn’t have to feel torn between wanting their team to win or lose.  ",nhl,1553459712,djounincorporated,10,6,True,2019-03-24

176,Is Mcdavid too much of an opportunistic type player to carry a team?," 

So  after the Oilers dropped not one but TWO games against Ottawa, I've  been thinking the Oilers roster while maybe lacking still doesn't  compare to the dungheap that is Ottawa.  So why can't the Oilers at  least be somewhat more competitive with a player racking up as many  points as Mcdavid?

As has been noted  early on about the TYPE of game he plays is very similar to a player  like T. Hall, so much so that Hall wasn't able to fit too well next to  Mcdavid because of the overlapping in roles (Draisatl complimented  Mcdavid much better).  Of course Mcdavid is much more efficient at it  than Hall, but still it's a hard type of game to build your team play  around because it's mostly passive and relies on waiting for soft  openings to appear.  Mcdavid's game doesn't seem to elevate his team  much.  I have included a couple of clips to make my point more clear.

[https://streamable.com/mcbkj](https://streamable.com/mcbkj) (Note how he is behind the players so he can get clear lanes to rush)

[https://streamable.com/wrytd](https://streamable.com/wrytd) (gets away a lot with pushing player's out of his way lol, doesn't try too hard)

\- He's not someone who attacks teams head on, confronting them front and center.

\-  He likes to lay low til opportunity arises, wait for a loose puck that  happens to pop out behind the guys battling for it so that he can jump  on it with no one around.

\- He mostly only drives to the net on a rush where he can catch guys backpedaling on their heels a bit.

\-  He doesn't make up for areas where other player's on his team are  lacking, he doesn't back them up so that even if a player on his team  does mes up at least they won't have to pay for it.

\-  He's not a player who's going to go out and take care of handling the  tougher aspects involved in playing an opponent, he doesn't prevent the  opposition from playing their game.

\-  He isn't pushing the opposition's strengths back and opening up a path  for his team to follow.  His game isn't forceful enough to soften up  hard opponents.

I'm not saying he  should play a different type of game, it's clearly effective for him and  points are points.   But I don't think his style of play is the most  conducive for making a team more competitive.",nhl,1553529507,mpiki,15,1,True,2019-03-25

178,"Tavares, Mcdavid, Ekblad and... Sean Day?","So with the OHL draft steadily approaching, I learned of the consensus number 1 pick Shane Wright and how he received exceptional status. I decided to do a bit of research around the honor of exceptional status and when I came across the names of former OHL specific exceptional status players, one really caught my eye in Sean Day.

So who is Sean Day? Day is a 21 year old defenceman playing in the echl for the Maine Mariners which may come as a surprise after reading the names he is in company with. Sean is a former 3rd round pick of the New York Rangers.

Backstory:

When Sean was just a 14 year old kid he was already a full grown man standing at 6'3 and 220 lbs. Day also had the skills to back up his size. A Michigan Based NHL scout described Day as ""What Paul Coffey would have looked like at the same age-fastest thing on the ice"". Later on in that year, Day and his family would submit his name for exceptional status consideration in which he would be granted. At the time Day would have been the 4th player in OHL history to qualify for exceptional status alongside Mcdavid, Tavares and Ekblad. At age 15 Sean Day would be drafted by the Missisauga Steelheads fourth overall in the OHL draft behind Travis Konecny, Dylan Strome and Matthew Spencer. Pick 19 in that draft was Mitch Marner, pick 64 was Matthew Tkachuk. In his rookie season with Missisauga, Day would score 6 goals and 10 assists for 16 points in 60 games, which was not a bad rookie season especially for a 16 year old defenceman. It is the following season where Day would raise his season numbers to 10 goals and 26 assists for 36 points in 61 games which was a positive sign. However in Day's draft year of 2016 where he was supposed to really take his game to the next level and compete to be a top 10 selection he had a very underwhelming performance putting up just 6 goals and 16 assists for 22 points leading to be a 3rd rounder in that years draft.

&amp;#x200B;

What Happened?

Nobody could really explain what had happened to Sean Day completely, however certain scouts were beginning to point out red flags in his game. For example one OHL scout said ""He could get by on ability alone. His hockey sense and competitiveness were nowhere near Ekblads at the same age. Fact is it almost seemed like he got bored when he played."" Day was also seen as uncommitted and childish at times, when asked what he needed to work on most with NHL central scouting Day replied with ""weight control"" which proved to be true as he was cut from the U18 Canadian team after showing up late to the tryout and weighing in at just under 250lbs. So really it seems that maturity and commitment is what really held back Sean as he clearly had the Skills to be a successful NHL player. 

&amp;#x200B;

Whats Next?

For Sean the future seems to be quite unclear. If he continues to act this way I see no scenario where he makes the NHL. However it is clear that he has the talent to be a successful NHL player so if he can turn himself around he could one day make it. Day needs to start small though, playing for the Maine Mariners Day has 4 goals and 11 assists for 15 points in 19 games which earned him a spot on Hartford where he has 2 goals and 8 assists for 10 points in 38 games. Day is going to need to drastically improve his game in his own end however as he is a minus 18 on the season and with production like he has been showing he will not make it to the league. Personally I see day as a career AHL player.",nhl,1553546680,Cha5chuk7,0,6,True,2019-03-25

315,How many pads/blockers do NHL goalies use per season?,"Okay, so I bought a game used Ben Bishop blocker when he used to play for Ottawa. Since there was no “Certificate of authenticity” I decided to look up photos during the 2012-2013 season to match the blocker. That’s where I ran into a few problems. One photo I saw had a “K” marked on the “K” of the Reebok underneath the Blocker. I understand that’s the signature of the NHL professional goalie equipment guru who makes sure every pad is up to code. On another photo of the “same” blocker, there was a “K” on the “R” of the Reebok logo. I’ve matched the exact blocker in a few photos but I also saw a few marks that were not even there or even reflected when the blocker itself wasn’t. So this leads me to wonder.

321,share your ideas for the best NHL playoff format,"what are your ideas for the best NHL playoff format?  


My only problem with the what team is in what division placed fifth overall what is that it's confusing a bit. What about:  


PICK YOUR POISON PLAYOFF DRAFT  
Sixteen teams qualify for the playoffs. Let the best team choose who they play in the first round. The second best chooses next and so on. You want rivalries? Oh, baby.

  
MORE PLAYOFFS  
Shorten the season to 70 games. At that point, 12 teams have secured playoff spots. The other 18 fight it out in a Wild Card Tournament for the last four spots. Only 1 team (the worst in the league), doesn't play at all and the city changes all of their official signage to ""Losertown"" for a year.

  
CONFERENCE PLAYOFFS  
Go back to conference playoffs. If the travel is too much use VR.  


GAME 7 SPECIAL  
All game sevens are decided by taking twenty people at random from each team's city and forcing them to play a game of hockey. They get one practice with the actual coach. I know the problem but I'm way ahead of you. If a baby is picked at random it can play in one big skate or two tiny ones (baby's choice rule).

Tonight I'm at Leafs Lightning. It's a Thursday, fans aren't quite so bumping, but man this is two quality teams going for it! Every mistake costs. Might not have as much on the line but the hockey is amazing. Gotta give some love to both teams. Am I just ignorant or is this exciting stuff?

334,Nhl playoff reformat.,"I think there should be: 8 Divisions; 4 teams in each.   32 team league.

4 Conferences; 2 divisions in each. 
1) Pacific, 2) West &gt; Pacific West Conf. 
3) North, 4) Central &gt; North Central Conf. 
5) Eastern, 6) Great Lakes &gt; Eastern-Great Lakes.
7) South, 8) Atlantic &gt; South Atlantic Conf. 

Example 1...
8 Divisions; 4 teams in each.
Pac-West Conf.
West Div.: Seat, Van*, Calg**, Edm 
Pacific Div.: SJose, LA*, Ana**, LV 
(* &amp; **exemplified below)

North-Central Conf.
Central: Dal, Ariz/Hous?/Kans?, Col, Nash 
North: Minn, Chic, St.L, Columb 

Eastern-Great Lakes Conf.
Great Lakes: Wpg, T.O., Det, Buff. 
Eastern: Ott, Mon, Bos, Pitts? 

South-Atlantic Conf.
South: Tamp, Miami, Car, Wash, Miami (if Florida relocate?) Pitts (probably)
Atlantic: NYI, NYR, NJ, Phila. 

Regular Seasonal: Play 80 games. 

Playoffs: - All 1st place teams in the 8 Divisions adv., seeded 1 thru 8 (according to league standards). Essentially tantamount to a 'Buy'.

The 2nd place teams in each division would play a 3-game series (team with most points, wins, best head to head divisionally gets home ice advantage) against the cross-divisional/intra-conference rivals.

*Example (see above)
(i.e. Pacific-West Conf;
West div., 2nd place team (Van) plays against
Pacific 2nd place team (LA) - winner advances.

...continued
4 teams would then adv., seeded 9-12. 
(according to league standings at season-end). 

Then, all 3rd place teams in each division would play a 3-game series (team with most points, wins, best head to head divisionally gets home ice advantage) against the cross-divisional/intra-conference rivals.

**Example (see above)
(i.e. Pacific-West Conf;
West div., 3rd place team (Calg) plays against
Pacific 2nd place team (Ana) - winner advances.

...continued
- 4 teams would then advance.   Seeded 13-16th.
(according to league standings at season-end).

A 17th team gets a position... 
The remaining teams (2nd &amp; 3rd place, 8 in total) who were eliminated, are put into a draw ('a hat'), and 1 team is randomly selected, and is the 17th seed. 

Google 17-team single elimination bracket which will show you the bracket format for 17 teams playoffs. 

The first round should be a 5 game series, remaining playoffs 7-game format. 

PS. I also think the team that travels most in each division, should get (1 point) added at year-end. 
So...a team like Wpg or a Florida team will likely get that 1 point. (as an example)

Having the team who has fewest suspensions, fines, and penalty minutes, (essentially fair play) - should also get (1 point) added at the end of year.

Series you’re looking forward to most:

East - I’m a Bruins fan, so I’m biased.  But Boston/Toronto is gonna be a heated rematch from last year

West: Really looking forward to Vegas/San Jose.  Wouldn’t be surprised if the winner goes in to play on the Western conference finals 

“Upsets” to watch for? (Use that term loosely because it’s the NHL)

East: Nothing would surprise me outside of a first round Tampa loss, but my sneaky pick would be those jerks in Carolina ousting the champs.  Just sounds like something a jerk would do 

West: Vegas wouldn’t shock me although I picked the Sharks in 7

Eastern Conference Champs: I want the B’s and wouldn’t be surprised if they went on a run, but despite all their high powered offense in Tampa, I think they win he East due to the best goalie in the world (Vasilevskiy) *pukes down front of hoodie*
All that said, GO CBJ!!

Western Conference Champs: A great argument can be made for the top 6 teams I feel, but in the playoffs with Rinne and that D corps, my nod goes to Smashville until they prove me wrong. 

Stanley Cup Champs: My brain says Tampa but my heart will be with Nashville of this is the case.  Nashville will need a near perfect and a very disciplined series, but stranger things have happened (and likely will).  Preds in a phenomenal 7 game series.

**WSH vs CAR** - Carolina could potentially pull an upset, but it'll be hard to do with Ovie, Kuzy, &amp; Holtby on the other team.

**NYI vs PIT** - It's fair game (go Isles).

**CGY vs COL** - It's not likely for an upset. To me, this series is more like WSH vs CAR, but in the west.

**VGK vs SJ** - This could go anyway.

**NSH vs DAL** - If Bishop is out, Khudobin has to stand on his head this series to upset Smashville.

**WPG vs STL** - Laine is too busy playing FortNite, and can't put up points against the Blues, jk. St. Louis is heating up at the right time right when Winnipeg is cooling down at the wrong time. Overall, it's highly probable that St. Louis upsets Winnipeg in the first round.

Now I am in no way implying that this astronomical phenomenon has any relation to the former Edmonton great - but let’s be honest, it was the first thing we thought of when we heard the name. (For the record it was named after the astronomer who discovered it- Charles Messier- but he has literally hundreds of stellar objects named after him) 

Why not immortalize Mark Messier’s career by pushing folks to refer to it as “Messier 1990” after Messier’s greatest season.   Don’t get me wrong- Mark had a good year in 87- won a cup, got over 100 points. But it was one of the few years in those days he didn’t make the All Star team.  

In 1990, he won the cup without Gretzky, won the Hart Trophy AND the Pearson trophy, plus made the All Star team. 

Let’s start a #Messier1990 campaign to change the name and raise awareness of a great hockey player and humanitarian!  And by the way, the black hole has half a dozen scientific designations, so it’s not like changing the common name will do anything to like “disrupt science”.

98,Two of the most common anti-Patrick Kane memes on Twitter have it exactly backwards.,"It's always seemed very odd to me that so much of Twitter - feminists and (lol) male feminists, +scumbag low IQ rival fans, continue to treat Kane on Twitter as if he's a rapist. It would be difficult, short of an accuser holding a press conference to publicly recant and admit it was all made up, for an accused to be more fully, clearly, or explicitly exonerated by investigators than Kane was of that crime. He did not do it. It really isn't up for debate or subject to interpretation. He did not rape that girl. All evidence indicates he was the victim of a brutal false accusation and extortion attempt by a family that had a reputation locally for such underhanded things (they have since fled the area as a family in ignominy, relocating to the south atlantic coast, there presumably to continue their lives as grifters.

&amp;#x200B;

Patrick Kane can hardly be mentioned on Twitter without at least one reply of ""She said no"". But the girl in question has likely never or nearly never said no in her life, both by the accounts of those who know her, and the physical evidence in the case, which found multiple men's semen samples in her underwear, neither of which belonged to the man she was accusing of having raped her. She didn't say no - Patrick Kane said no. He said, No, you cannot get millions of dollars as a reward for falsely accusing me of a heinous crime and dragging my name through the mud and putting my family through Hell, endangering my freedom, my future, my livelihood. No, you go away. Kane won that case by saying no, if you remember back. As did the Blackhawks. Do you remember the atmosphere? Everyone was waiting for the Hawks or the NHL to ""do something"" to him. Meanwhile the extortionist and her family and her lawyer were waiting for Kane to break, to finally pay them 7 figures to go away and leave him alone. But the extortionist didn't realize who she was dealing with. And the media monsters in Chicago didn't realize who they were dealing with, in the Hawks organization. Kane didn't get to be where and who he is by being weak, by being scared, by running away. By letting pressure break him. Time passed and as time passed the pressure went off of Kane and onto his extortionist and her party, as their desperate attempt to rob this innocent man fell apart. The pressure went onto them and it broke them. In their desperation, seeing their cash grab fall apart before their eyes, they brazenly tampered with evidence in the vain hope of salvaging their leverage (they did not of course ever want or intend the thing to go to trial; but with no evidence, with physical evidence pointing to complete innocence, with multiple supposed eyewitnesses, friends of the girl, backing out of their support of her version of events, they had lost any leverage in the extortion attempt; Kane had called their bluff and won). Then their lawyer quit, then the extortionist gave up so as not to be charged herself, then the DA said enough and gave a press conference saying he had been closer to charging the girl than Kane. And clearing him of any guilt.

&amp;#x200B;

All of that happened. It is all true. You can go check. It all happened in broad daylight. It made the news. Then Kane returned to the ice and won the MVP. He was pissed. No one in the Chicago media ever apologized for treating him like a rapist scumbag criminal for months, for saying he should be traded or released or suspended, for treating him as if he were guilty. And no one ever has. The girl, the extortionist, continued cheerleading at Buffalo, faced no suspension, no scrutiny, no charges. Ever. But locals knew what she was and what she'd done, what her family was and what they'd done. And so the family packed up and relocated, having worn out their welcome. To this day this girl can still be seen on social media coming on to pro athletes. I hope her name is known to them and none of them ever get caught near her. Patrick Kane was not her first victim. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now. All that being true, what kind of absolute scumbag liar piece of filth must one be to waltz into a Pat Kane mention on Twitter and say, ""She said no."" Or call him a rapist. Or say - and this is the other common one - that guys with money like he has have a way of getting away with things. His money is why he got away with it? No, his money is why he was targeted, it's why he was victimized. A regular schlub isn't getting that accusation from that human shark, bc there is no wealth to steal. And then there are the dozens of references, any time he's mentioned on Twitter, of things like ""Great player, shit human being."" Or the usual from girls, openly feminist, acting as if he's a rapist, treating him like he's subhuman or scum of the earth. ""He makes me throw up."" If you asked them why, what would they say? Some would at least have the good grace to not claim it's bc of a rape accusation he was the only victim of. These liars say it's bc of the cab driver thing or his drunken Cinco De Mayo antics from when he was a kid. But of course that's horse shit, and none of them were saying any such things about him prior to the rape case. The feminists meanwhile would just say it's bc he's a rapist. He isn't, but if you say he is, it'll be as if he is, I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway here's to Patrick Kane. A great player. A great teammate and friend (I have been watching hockey a long time and have never heard teammates speak as glowingly of a teammate as guys like Sharp and Burish and Panarin do of Kane, whom they clearly love), a good guy in the community, a good guy to fans. Was he a drunken punk and womanizer when he was a college age kid playing in the NHL? By all accounts, sure was. Is he fundamentally a bad guy? No one who has had dealings with him the past many years has ever said so. The nastiness and intensity of the attacks on this man's character are the most unfair and cruel thing I have ever seen in my life as a sports fan. The way he has conducted his career on-ice has of course been exemplary (he is the greatest US player of all time, and imo the best player or certainly a top 3 player of his generation - and the modern player I would most want on the ice in a game 7 to decide it all). But the way he conducted himself OFF the ice when faced with that firestorm, that proto-#MeToo witch hunt and legal extortion attempt and media coordinated relentless attack on him was - amazing. He was as strong and calm and clutch and skilled off the ice in that instance, as graceful, as he has ever been on it. He rose to the occasion. And he has never shrunk since. I am writing all this in part bc he has never written all this, or said all this. He has never said a word about any of it after his brief to the point statement of fact at the time that he had done nothing wrong. He's let the scumbags continue to drag his name through the mud, hurt his family, and speak their evil lies with impunity. So. Let the record show.  #KaneForHart",nhl,1550399715,RestingBriLarsonFace,16,1,True,2019-02-17

If you're interested, you could assume control of the team this year for no cost, just to provide an opportunity to get a feel for the rules and configuration.

Entry fee is $150 per season, though we'd be looking for a 2-year buy-in up front.

125,ECHL questions,"I would post this at the ECHL reddit, but it seems there's not much activity on that side. I am trying to get a better understanding of the ECHL and it's role in an NHL organization. 

So here's some questions if anyone has the time. 

When an ECHL club is affiliated with an AHL &amp; NHL club, what does this actually mean? Is there a set number of prospects that are on an echl roster? And I guess what are the odds of any player getting the call to move up the ranks?

Due to affiliations, are ECHL players only allowed to progress within the affiliates teams or can any other AHL/NHL team scoop someone up?

I'm really just trying to get a better understanding of this league and how it differs from the AHL. 

Thanks to anyone who assists

141,Why I think Nylander's contract will be a steal in a few years.,"The constant hatred William Nylander experiences throughout leafs nation is crazy. still after recording 9pts in his last 11 games played while being a +8. Also while getting just over 14mins per game.

comparisons

**William Nylander**

through *first* ***215Games Played: 147Pts*** that's just under 0.68pts per game (this is including the cold streak he had at the beginning of this season)

**David Pastrnak**

through *first* ***215 games played: 154Pts*** just over 0.71pts per game

&amp;#x200B;

after taking away all stats from this year for Nylander the comparisons look like this (signing year)

Nylander: **185Games played 135pts just under 0.73pts per game** signed for ***$6.962Mill***

Pastrnak: **185Games played 137pts also 0.74pts per game** signed for ***$6.666Mill***

as you can see here the difference between these two contracts is only ***$296,000***

&amp;#x200B;

My Rant

It's hard to understand why Pastrnak's contact be considered a **huge steal** when Nylander has been putting up just under the same amount of points as him, and Nylander contract is a **""big waste of money""**...

I love the leafs, they're my favourite team. But he is 100% worth this contract, especially after the way he has been playing recently (last 11 games). he is only 22 years old and has plenty of time to grow

Not certain if this is accurate but I’ve been watching NSH and they seem to maintain “neat” lines of play and go with a long ranged pass and shoot style, do correct me if I’m wrong.

255,Farewell to Mats Zuccarello From A New York Rangers Fan,"Mats Zuccarello (RW), a.k.a. ‘the Wizard’, ‘the Hobit’, should have been completely off-limits in the trade market. He is irreplaceable – both on, and off the ice.

Zuccarello is the ultimate team player. I say this because: he takes team friendly contracts so the Rangers have cap space to sign other elite players; he’s the nucleus and core of NYR that makes their orbit turn; has consistently been the white knight – especially during the deep playoff runs over the years, which resulted in one Stanley Cup final appearance.

He is easily one of the most underrated NHL players, with smarts that mirror some of the most brilliant players in the league – such as Patrick Kane. He makes everyone he plays with much, much better because of his high end play-making ability and hockey IQ. 
In the nine years I’ve watched him play for the Rangers, never once did I see a lousy shift or pass from him – only high risk passes and shots that seem to always connect to teammates, or land in the back of opponents net. 

Let’s look at some of Zuc’s statistics during his nine year tenure with the Rangers to get a perspective of how much he contributes. 

Disclaimer – I’ll be using the metric called ‘Corsi’ to make my case. Corsi is a fancy term for overall shot attempts (shots + missed shots + blocked shots… not counting empty net shots); it measures a player or team’s puck possession at even strength. A player, or team, is considered elite if they have a Corsi that falls in the range of 55% or higher – and players/teams that fall below 45% are considered below average. 

So let’s start here: Zuccarello has a corsi of 55.9% in the nine seasons he played for the Rangers, in which he played 508 games, and had a total of 9,045 minutes on ice. He never fell below 51.4% in each of those nine seasons, and had several years where he was in the high fifties and sixties. 

What I’m saying is Zuccarello dominates opposition when he’s on the ice – and gives the Rangers quality scoring opportunities that result in winning games. 

Again, it will be very difficult to replace what Zuccarello brought to the table.

It’s a grim time for ‘Rag fans – as in you can’t count on them to make quality trades, nor are they legitimately formidable at drafting quality players. In other words, don’t count on a Stanley Cup being raised at Madison Square Garden (MSG) anytime soon.

Zuc has a career total of 348 points (113 goals, 235 assists), and is plus 37 during regular season play – and has 31 points (11 goals, 20 assists) in 60 playoff games. He has 96 career power play points during the regular season as well.

I wish ‘the Wizard’ all the success going forward for the Dallas Stars, and any other teams he may play on in the future.

291,"In the last 4yrs, Ducks GM B.M. has lost TWO top line/pair players, Theodore &amp; W. Karlsson, for nothing. Hes been Ducks GM 10+yrs, &amp; has acquired ZERO top line Fs or top pair dmen. His rival GM, Doug Wilson, has acquired THREE such players (E Karlsson, Kane, Nyquist) in just the last ONE yr","I am a fed up fan of the Ducks, and I want to get the truth out there about the question, ""How do we judge Bob Murray's tenure as GM of the Ducks?"" so I am posting it here, to neutral NHL fans of all teams, where it can be judged fairly, instead of with the bias that can often come with being a fan of the Ducks or any team. The reason the title refers to SJ is, what better way to judge Murray's performance than by comparing him to Pac division rival GMs? Here I go. 

In the time Murray has been Ducks GM, Sharks GM Doug Wilson has added six top players, and given up none to get them. These are as follows: Brent Burns, Dany Heatley, Erik Karlsson, Dan Boyle, Evander Kane, Gustav Nyquist. Before that, he acquired Joe Thornton. 

In that same time, Murray's only ""top"" addition was an already declining, injury prone Ryan Kesler, in his late twenties, one year away from an 8 year contract extension that would include maybe 3 more good, but declining, seasons, then 4-5 seasons of paying an AHL player 8 million a year. I wonder why Wilson and other GMs passed on that one.

In that same time, Murray has TRADED the following players: Andy Mcdonald, Chris Pronger (for injury prone Lupul and low skill Luca Sbisa), Bobby Ryan (but only let teams willing to acquire him without sending salary back bid on him, killing the market, even though he had cap room and would have had more had he not given out so many bad contracts like 3+ mil a year to Clayton Stoner and Bryan Allen on multi-year deals), Brandon Montour, William Karlsson, Jake Gardiner (for an aging Beauchemin Murray let go from the Ducks the prior offseason over money and term, then he traded Gardiner to acquire him at that money and term. Doh), Kyle Palmieri (for a lone 2nd round pick), lost Shea Theodore and Justin Schultz for nothing, and let once promising prospects like Emerson Etem and Peter Holland, former 1st round picks of his, and Devante Smith Pelly, I believe a 2nd round pick of his, lose all their value without trading them, despite the Ducks being in a contending window.

When it comes to +/- on adding/losing elite players (defined as top line forward or top pairing DMAN), over the last 10 years, Murray has lost six (Pronger, Bobby Ryan, Brandon Montour soon to be a legit #2 IMO but we can judge 100% fairly in say two years, W. Karlsson, Shea Theodore, Kyle Palmieri), and acquired six. He is -6 in the plus/minus of acquiring top line/pair players during his ten year tenure. 

Doug Wilson is +3 in just the last year, +2 at minimum if you dont count Nyquist (high skill, 1 off 50 pts in 60 games), as a top line player. Over the last ten years, he is +5 (added Burns, Boyle, Kane, Heatley, Nyquist, traded away none). 

In terms of trading away vs acquiring YOUNG (let's say 25 years old and younger) top-six/top-four talent, Murray has also acquired ZERO during his ten year tenure, with Daniel Sprong being his latest but also best hope, while losing 5 (Karlsson, Theodore, Montour, Schultz, Gardiner), so he is -5. Doug Wilson I think acquired none but unlike Murray, lost none either, that I can recall.

I just wanted to put this out there. VGK GM George Mcphee has also traded for more top players in 1.5 years as VGK GM than Murray has in 10 years. The Flames have also traded for 2 young potential top line/top pair players this season (Lindholm and Hanifin) but only gave up one, and a top prospect. Murray traded all the players AND top prospects I already mentioned and got NONE back. And when the Ducks and Kings were both contending side by side 5+ years ago, the Kings were actually out of a playoff spot and they traded for Jeff Carter, an elite top-line center or winger, which pushed them over the top to their first Cup, then two years later in a similar situation, they traded for Marian Gaborik's last couple top line-ish seasons, leading to a second Cup. Murray as usual either did nothing at all, or something very damaging to the franchise (like William Karlsson AND A 2nd ROUND PICK in exchange for old injured James Wisniewski at the deadline, who then despite getting healthy was healthy scratched the entire playoff run because the coach didn't even think he was good enough to play. But he was good enough to give up William Karlsson and a 2nd round pick for), but nothing good. 

Is it any wonder that when the elite players Bob Murray INHERITED when becoming Ducks GM, like Getzlaf and Perry, were still in their primes, the Ducks STILL could never get over the top, and now that they are no longer in their primes, and the team is now for the first time basically entirely of Bob Murray's making, that the Ducks are one of the worst teams in the NHL?

Is it any wonder that with all that talent given away over the last 10 years, and ZERO of consequence acquired outside of one good complementary player (Silfverberg, now likely overpaid) and a declining 2nd liner (Kesler), that when the few elite players you had because you INHERITED them finally decline, WHICH IS KNOWN TO HAPPEN 10 years down the line but shh no one tell Murray that, your team will fall into the basement of the NHL?

I mean, who could have predicted such a thing? That's why I personally hope Murray is replaced ASAP. Clearly the team will never win another Cup with this level of incompetent leadership. Half the good young players are traded, along with half the top NHL players, yet ZERO good young players OR top NHL players are brought back. And now that Perry and Getzlaf are getting old, maybe Ducks ownership, and its many fans who keep deriding me for speaking the truth about this, will start to realize that's not a winning recipe, and never was (outside of Getzlaf and Perry still being there to carry the team and cover up for Murray's incompetence. I didn't even get into the Kevin Bieksa extension before he ever played a game for the Ducks, which included a NMC, which led a SECOND avoidable situation where Murray chose to let Shea Theodore walk rather than be 'unloyal' to Bieksa and ask him to waive his NTC even though Vegas never would have picked him, along with the fact that Murray needed that move to unload the OTHER 3mil + per year multi-year contract he gave out to ANOTHER gritty character pylon, in this case Clayton Stoner. Two awful mistakes put Murray in a situation to lose one of his young dmen, then he made the third mistake to go through with it instead of just asking Bieksa to waive his NMC and buying out Stoner, then he made a fourth mistake giving up Theodore instead of Montour just because Montour had a better postseason, i.e. recency bias. OK now I did get into it! Lol).

And there are so many other examples. So I really hope taking the time to write this post at least gets the word out a little bit, and maybe it can lead to the changes occurring in Anaheim that need to if the team is ever going to be successful again.

374,"In terms of speed, is Mark Stone going to be able to keep up with the NHL as a top offensive producer in 3-4 years?","Mark Stone is big, skilled, great shot, great passer, great hockey sense, a smart defensive player with a great stick... and yet, he's not the fastest player.

When I think of all the forwards the last 10 years or so who were slow, yet either produced as top offensive players for multiple years, or even just had one breakout year, these are some of the first names I think of...

Ryan Getzlaf, Corey Perry, Bobby Ryan, Dany Heatley, Derek Stepan, Ryan Callahan, Dustin Brown, Anze Kopitar, Milan Lucic, David Backes, Jason Spezza, Joe Pavelski, Patrick Hornqvist, Adam Henrique, John Tavares, David Clarkson, Mike Richards, Ville Leino, James Neal, Joe Thornton, etc.

Almost every single one of them hit a wall, offensively, very early in their carers, relatively speaking, in many cases before 30 years old, that in many cases lasted permanently, or in other cases only returned inconsistently at best, except for just a few players like Ryan Getzlaf (who is finally now the last year or two starting to decline as well, at 32-33 years old. Mark Stone's contract runs until 35...), Joe Thornton (in his prime, a 120 point player. Stone's career high is what 70?), Anze Kopitar (even he has had mysteriously bad down years of production, and his goal scoring has never matched what Kings fans expected from someone as big and skilled, with a good shot, like he has. Hard to imagine why...), and... actually that's it.

Is Mark Stone, at age 26, even on the level that Ryan Getzlaf was age 26? Even John Tavares looked like a non-factor to start last season, then he found his legs and has been on a tear ever since, including this season, but how long will it last? Even if Tavares' prime lasts until 35, has Mark Stone ever been on Tavares level? Up until this year when Toews refound his legs, he had also declined well before age 35, yet at age 26, I'd say he was much faster and better than Stone is now. So if he couldn't last as a top line player until age 35, barring this season and who knows how long the resurgence lasts, will Stone?

See what I'm saying? Dany Heatley was a 50 goal scorer, then couldnt even play in the NHL anymore. Corey Perry and Bobby Ryan were both I believe 40+ goal scorers in their primes, Perry hit 50, yet both are now bottom six players basically well before age 35.

Now I understand, Stone is much better defensively than Heatley and even Perry. That's fine, I don't dispute that. So was Ryan Kesler but by age 32 or 33 he was also an 8 million dollar per year player who really didn't belong above the 3rd or 4th line, defensive ability or not, and Mark Stone is signed at 9.5 until age 35, so...

I'd just be a little concerned about it if I were the Vegas Golden Knights GM George Mcphee, and ironically it's the deal I would be least concerned about. It's crazy to think just in the last year how he has traded a 1st round pick, two or three 2nd round picks, two of his organization's three best prospects, *and* committed 23 million dollars PER YEAR in salary cap space to three players for the next 4 to 8 years, all just to make his team SLOWER lol. I don't get it at all. Adding Mark Stone is one thing, probably not for 8 years but for the next 5, sure, but you'd think the rest of that money and those assets would have been put towards making the team faster and building on what made the VGK stand out last year, rather than on seemingly declining, seemingly one dimensional, seemingly no-longer-fast, players.

Despite being outshot, the Wings look pretty solid tonight. Outstanding performances from Zadina and Bernier almost allowed Detroit to slip away with a win. Dekeyser and AA struggled early but managed to salvage an okay performance in the later periods of the game.

Zadina certinaly stole the show with a breakout performance, in which he recorded his first NHL goal. From the first period on he was one of the strongest skaters for the wings and no doubt the most exciting. Larkin and Mantha quietly had average/good performances. Nielsen and Bertuzzi roundout the notable performances from the forwards. Nielsen worked hard throughout the game and Bertuzzi dealt with the Colorado crowd nicely.

Bowey had the most surprising defensive performance. His skating was crisp, and he looked like a nice pair with Ericsson and notably Kronwall. Dekeyser was burned a couple times by the speedy first line of the Avalanche, though he never quit in the game and as aforementioned managed to salvage a impactful performance.

Bernier dealt with the dangerous Colorado first line nicely. However, the late goal in regulation by Barrie was one he should have had. If the shot from the point doesn't go in the Wings most likely walk away with a win.",nhl,1551852898,lightthelampdetroit,0,3,True,2019-03-06

480,New Shootout Idea - Chaser,"Some people have been really up in arms about the skater hitting the brakes and slowing down to a crawl in the shootout, in order to stick handle back and forth and back the goalie way into the net.  I understand why some feel forward momentum is a problem here.

There’s also people defending the move (i.e. those saying the goalie could just poke check the guy).  But if it were that easy goalies would be doing it. 

Idea: 

What if... there was a defender who got to try and chase down the shooter.  The defender/backchecker could start at the hash marks or further back and the shooter at the red line or blue line.  This would simulate a little more of a “hockey play” , or a breakaway situation where someone could get back and help the goalie.

Similar rules for the backchecker could apply where you have to use a different guy each round.  Maybe not be able to use a chaser once he’s shot or vice versa.

It would make the shootout a little more intense. You’d lose some of the phenomenal moves you see because of the speed but you’d also see a host of different moves because you’d have to protect the puck.  Shooters who come in at a half decent pace would probably mostly be unaffected by the backchecker.  But it would put some pressure on them knowing they could be caught.

Thoughts?

495,Tweaking the Playoff Seeding Format,"TL;DR - Instead of going back to playoff seeding being based on conference standing 1-8, go to 4 Wild Card teams per conference.

&amp;#x200B;

I saw over on r/BostonBruins that with Vegas beating Calgary last night, the Bruins had moved into 2nd in the league behind Tampa thanks to fewer games played. Immediately, I thought about last year's Western Conference playoffs where we saw the Predators and the Jets square off in the 2nd round, even though those two teams held the first and second best records in the league respectively. I know there's been a lot of talk about moving back to the playoff seeding being based on 1-8 in the conference, but it sounds like the league has no plans to even consider making that change.

All that said, I feel as though the best chance of getting a change to the playoff format would come next off season, right before Seattle enters the league. With their entry, each division will once again have an even number of teams, thus solving the problem that the current wild card format sought to fix.

My thought is to expand the wild card pool. So instead of having each division with three teams make the playoffs and then two conference based wild cards, go to each division sending two teams, with four conference based wild cards. The teams that clinched playoff births through divisional play will automatically get home ice, and the four divisional teams will be matched up with the wild cards based on overall record. 

So taking this year's Eastern Conference standings at the moment, the first round would be as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

A1 TBL vs WC4 MTL         M1 WAS vs WC2 CAR

A2 BOS vs WC3 PIT          M2 NYI vs WC1 TOR

&amp;#x200B;

For comparison's sake, this is what this year would look like with 1-8 seeding:

&amp;#x200B;

1 TBL v 8 MTL

2 BOS v 7 PIT

3 TOR v 6 CAR

4 WAS v 5 NYI

&amp;#x200B;

As far as second round matchups are concerned, the format wouldn't change. Clearly, in this scenario,  Boston and Toronto avoid each other in the first round, therefore increasing the chances that we see teams with better records go deeper. Although Boston still runs into Tampa in the second round in this scenario (if they win their series) the winner of that round still has a chance to get Toronto in the ECF.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess Chris Rock was right when he said he never felt like your stereotypical black man...... Until he stepped out into Canada.

 It was just kind of hard to watch because I grew up with a proud African American friend. His racism on the ice affected me to a large degree but we got passed it and has some good times on the ice together. You have to nip those cheap jokes in the butt or else it's open season on you until the end. ( Luckily my friend did) but I was shocked to see how receptive Reaves was towards that kind of talk. He might look and play tough hockey but away from the rink, I can tell that the boys most likely make fun of him ( lips shapes, thick hair, skin tone etc) If ESPN got a hold of this than they would have made it a 1-3 day report of his racist hockey culture is. 

The sport could really use a infusion of some African-Americans. Guy's like Steph Curry and Lonzo Ball who maybe grew up with more white people probably wouldn't want to come into a environment like that.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll start off by sharing my postseason forecast.

&amp;#x200B;

I think Pacific is more or less set with the Flames, Sharks, and Knights, in no particular order.

I kept on expecting the Flames to drop off, but after watching a few of their games, they actually seem pretty legit this year. Sharks and Knights, I expected nothing less of them this year. (Disclaimer: I'm a Knights fan).

&amp;#x200B;

For Central, I believe Jets and Preds are pretty much postseason locks. I think Stars have a good chance to take the third spot, but I think the Wild have a better than 50% chance to surge up to steal the third spot from the Stars. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the two Western wild-card spots, I think it'll come down to 3 teams fighting for the two spots: Stars, Avs, and Ducks.

&amp;#x200B;

In the Atlantic, I believe Lightning, Maple Leafs, and Bruins pretty much have it locked up.

&amp;#x200B;

In the Metro, it seems to be the most contested division in the league, but I think the Penguins, Capitals, and Islanders will finish the season as the top 3 for that division.

&amp;#x200B;

For the two Eastern wild-card spots, I think it'll come down to the Blue Jackets and Habs.

66,"I hate team-switchers, but I'm switching teams.","So, to preface, I'm not the best hockey fan. I love the sport to death, but I haven't been able to reliably keep up with hockey most of my adult life because of life, football, and more life because I'm super-busy. I am now super-invested in my team by looking at stats and potential trades and what our future outlook looks like. I'm about to un-cut the cord and get a cable box to watch the local games. I don't want to miss any more hockey.

Originally, I was a Devils fan. That came about because the first video game I was able to purchase with my own money was NHL Hitz 20-02 for $7 brand new at Sears. I LOVED that game. Played the absolute tits off of it even though I knew nothing of hockey. And because I knew nothing about hockey, I knew I needed a good goal tender, so I picked the team with the best goalie, who at the time was Martin Brodeur. 

I only played with the Devils and I beat that game to death. I grew to love the whole team (Elias, Gomez, Neidermayar, Stevens, etc.) - then I started watching the Stanley Cup Playoffs that year and we won the Stanley Cup, much to the chagrin of my dad's friend/my peewee football coach, who was a giant Rangers fan. And I was hooked...until the next regular season started.

Since then, I never really consistently kept up with regular season hockey because it just wasn't something I thought about. It wasn't something my dad was very into. I was the only person in my friend group that even remotely gave a shit about hockey. So my love for hockey would be pretty dormant until playoff time. I'd watch the Devils play in super tight games during the playoffs and I watched them sputter against LA in 2013.

The hardest thing for me to come to terms with though is the loss in the playoffs to the Hurricanes in the 2006 playoffs. 

My family and I moved to NC in 2001 because my parents were both in the military. I didn't even know Carolina had a hockey team until I saw them play the Devils in the playoffs, so for me, when the Canes beat the Devils, I haaaaated the Hurricanes for being so damn lucky. But in the years since that series, I've gone to school, graduated, became a professional and moved to the Triangle area, where there resides a professional hockey team that I've hated for all my teenage years.

I've grown apart from the Devils. I hadn't watched them in a long time until last year because I only made time to watch playoff hockey in the spring. As much love as I got for them and their up-and-coming young guys, I just don't feel connected to that team anymore; even a fraction of what I felt than when Brodeur was still there.

And as my love for the Devils had drifted away, I've grown to love the Canes since moving here a year and a half ago. It's easier to now, especially since we've hit a bit of an unprecedented hot streak, but I know in the back of my mind that I hate the idea of switching teams. I've been a Raider fan all my life, so I know how to watch a sucky team suck for decades on end and I'm aware of the turmoil the Canes have suffered until recently. I'm as loyal as they come, so for me the idea of switching teams is almost blasphemous, especially when you throw around the term ""bandwagoner"". It's like flirting with hotter women behind your spouse's back when she's ill. I feel like I've betrayed myself, but rooting for my hometown team just feels right - it's not something I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing before now because until recently I've never lived in a city with a professional sports team.

And I guess there isn't any real reason for me to post this other than for my own catharsis. I want to not feel bad for switching because I'm not accountable to anybody else but myself, but I do. The Devils gave me some great moments, but I'm happy for my hometown team to give me a reason to watch/seek out hockey. I love this sport dearly and I'm grateful for this current Hurricanes team to reignite some of the feelings I had when I was a kid.

Somebody tell me it's okay. Haha

TLDR: I was a Devils fan as a kid, lived in NC for almost 20 years, I want to watch more exciting hockey so I'm a Canes fan now, but I'm dealing with it.",nhl,1547567591,TaquitoPrime,8,1,True,2019-01-15

91,"New Hockey Fan, Why Does Everyone Hate the Leafs?","Wasn't sure what to title this post, and I'm in no way trying to generalize all hockey fans. I just started watching hockey (NHL) this season and decided to cheer for the Leafs (for a few reasons–they are located close to me, some of my friends are fans, etc.). Anyway, I've noticed that when I read the comments (either on a YouTube highlight or a live chat during a stream) people like to hate on the Leafs. I'm talking about comments like ""And Canada's most hated team loses again! Lost 6 of the last 7! We'Re CuP CoNtEnDeRs, the deluded laughs fans say!﻿"" They also love to hate on Tavares, often calling him ""pyjama boy"" and ""traitor.""

&amp;#x200B;

94,The stupidity of our power play metric,"It’s always struck me as odd that the metric we use to measure the effective of power plays is the percentage of power plays they score on. By having a set denominator, you ignore all kinds of nuances in a power play’s effectiveness. For example, if a team fails to score on a two minute minor, the 0/1 is the same as if they fail to score on a five minute major, and the same as if they fail to score on a 30-second fragmented PP. A goal score 5 seconds into the power play counts the same as a goal scored 1:59 in. There’s no nuance to the stat for, say, a 4-on-3, which is much easier to score on than a 5-on-4. And, the king of example for why this is stupid: failing to score on a double minor (4 mins) is treated as worse than failing to score on a major (5 mins) despite being literally less power play time. You’d get an 0/2 for the 4 and an 0/1 for the 5. We just get a percentage of PP goals out of total power plays, regardless of the actual situation of those power plays.

My suggestion is the stat of expected goals per 2 minutes of power play time (or alternatively percentage of time a PP unit can be expected to score given 2 full minutes of 5-on-4). This would be easy to understand, easy to calculate, and a much more accurate measure of how effective a power play is. Then, you can weight goals scored on 5-on-3s and 4-on-3s and double goals on 5 minute majors (which right now are counted as 2/1—in theory a power play can actually be over 100% using this rule). 

Maybe I’m missing something, and feel free to let me know if I am. I’m also sure that some tinkering would have to be done, especially with weighting special situation goals. But to me it seems like this is a relatively easy change that would really help us better rate power plays.",nhl,1547693541,capsfan65,5,1,True,2019-01-16

130,Which NHL team should I support?,"Hello Guys,

I've just become interested in hockey and the NHL and therefore I'm ""searching"" for a team to support.

Because of that I'd like to ask you guys, which team could be a match for me.

I'm interested in teams playing as a team and in teams which are playing good D#. I kind of root for the underdogs all the times so I wouldn't mind supporting a ""bad"" team. Still I'd like to support a team with a bright future.

 I'm from Germany and therefore it would be cool if there was a german player on the roster but that's not really important for me (especially because I don't know that many german NHL players unfortunately). I'd like to support a team located in a nice city because I'd like to catch up NFL, NHL and NBA games once I visit the US or Canada.

Maybe you could even tell me, what team you support and why. That'd be pretty cool!

&amp;#x200B;

I'd really appreciate a few nice replies. I'm sorry if there are many mistakes in my text. Greetings from Germany and have a nice day! :)

It simply means they plan to expand the league in those directions which sucks for the players (way more travel away from the family) and sucks for the fans (games in bizarre time zones). Why doesn't the nhlpa tell the league where they can stuff those games the way the nhl has told the players they can forget the Olympics and World Cup? And if those are really 'promotional' why don't they have a positive impact on raising the salary cap as they benefit the owners a heck of a lot more than the players. ,nhl,1548084822,IronPetePEI,0,1,True,2019-01-21

Anyone else think that it would be better to have a league, and the winner of the league is the winner that season. And you have a separate knockout cup that runs at the same time. You could have one cup for just NHL teams, and then have a cup similar to the English FA Cup. Where every level of hockey participate in the cup, and the NHL teams enter at a later stage.

169,Playoff Format,"Crazy concept: how about the teams get ranked based on their regular season points in each conference from 1-8? At which point, the #1 seed plays the #8 seed, the #2 plays #7, #3 vs #6, and #4 vs #5. And then, get this, they reseed the bracket after each round, ensuring a balanced bracket. For those of you who haven't realized, my sarcastic tone is rooted in feelings of confusion and annoyance. The current system is stupid. The only point that I've heard which supports the Wild Card format is that is promotes rivalries in the first round, when the NHL doesn't compete with major sports as much. For us die hards, who care more about the game than the revenue, it makes the later rounds less competitive when a team from a weaker division moves on the to conference finals. Also, going back to a seeded bracket makes it possible for new rivalries to be created, instead of seeing the same teams play each other year in and year out. Chicago-Vancouver had a crazy rivalry because of the former system. Now, teams like Columbus and Toronto are left to fight against teams that can hold off in the regular season, like Pittsburgh, Washington, Boston or Tampa Bay, only to dominate in the post-season. At one point this year, Vegas was 4th in the league and 3rd in the Pacific. There is no reason that they should have to work that hard only to be seeded against San Jose (at the time was 2nd in the Pacific and 3rd in the league) and lose home-ice advantage.

Ovechkin currently has 643 midway through his 13th season. Gretzky who played 20 season, had 643 at the end of his 13th meaning Ovi is above pace to beat him. It makes me sick to think about the 116 games Ovi missed due to 2 NHL lockouts. He would be over 700 goals right now and on pace to score 1000 I think. That's neither here nor there though.

I think Ovi has at least 7 season left in him especially with how contact in the NHL is diminishing. He may play til he's 45 like Jagr. At 33 years old, he's still scoring hat tricks like it's nothing and he's most like gonna score 50 if not 60 goals this year. 

Currently he needs 251 more to beat the record. If he plays 7 more seasons he only needs to average 35 goals a year which is more than doable especially since he'll probably score 40-50 the next 3 seasons if not more. 

What do ya'll think? I think it's obvious what I think. It'd be amazing to see him play til 45 and score 1000. Fucking lockouts creating all these what ifs in my head. ",nhl,1548212749,aaronshattuck,18,1,True,2019-01-22

**\*** Elias Pettersson missed half the game against Montreal due to injury

&amp;#x200B;

As of January 23, these are the standings. Garland has been very impressive in January with 7 goals in 11 games played, and I won't be surprised if he wins. At the same time Elias Pettersson has a hat-trick and 6 points in less than 4 games played. Marcus Pettersson has been phenomenal this month, and has out-classed his defensive colleagues. But Rasmus Dahlin and Filip Hronek have had a good run too. And those are the main players in this rookie race. There are stats for other relevant rookies as well.

204,"NHL, NHLPA “Cautiously Optimistic” They’ll Avoid Work Stoppage in ’20","The Athletic published a story indicating that despite the option to re-open the league’s collective bargaining agreement in September, the NHL and NHLPA share a mutual desire to avoid a work stoppage in 2020. Author Pierre LeBrun reasoned that there is no “(single) [major issue](https://theathletic.com/767927/2019/01/15/lebrun-for-real-nhl-and-nhlpa-both-appear-to-want-long-term-labour-peace-not-another-lockout/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiossports&amp;stream=top) that is so paramount that either side wants to go to war over (it).” While there’s “cautious optimism” the 2 sides will be able to work out an agreement without a lockout, speculation about potential labor strife continues to exist because of the league’s history (see: 3 work stoppages in the last 25 years).

***Howie Long-Short***: Harvey Schiller is a distinguished sports executive, having served as Executive Director of the United States Olympic Committee, Chief Executive Officer of YankeeNets, President of Turner Sports and President of the Atlanta Thrashers. I asked the former NHL club executive, considering the owners got the hard cap &amp; larger percentage of gross revenues (from 43% to 50%) they sought during the last round of negotiations, **is there anything left to negotiate for that would be worth** **locking the players out to get?**

***Harvey****: I don’t think that there’s any benefit to locking the players out. You don’t want to hurt your fan base. You have some clubs just trying to survive (so, they need the revenue that the games bring), fan demographics are more fragmented than ever, and there are other sports trying to take the league’s market share; you don’t want to get crowded out while you’re sitting at home doing nothing.*

*There are also whispers of further expansion. You hear stories about Kansas City, Houston and maybe another club in the Toronto area. There’s a lot of upside for the NHL, so it’s not in their best interest to have a lockout.* *Unless there is a major issue that the public is not aware of, I would think that the owners would try to work something out.*

**What would motivate the players to pass on concessions the owners might offer to extend the deal and strike?**

***Harvey****: That’s a difficult question to answer, but the addition of new franchises (and the massive expansion fees they generate) is among the reasons; the players see that money coming in and want their share.*

*I think that the players have gotten more sophisticated (see:* [record number of NCAA alumni](http://collegehockeyinc.com/articles/2017/04/nhl-features-record-number-percentage-of-ncaa-alumni.php)*) and they have access to more information with the rise of social media over the last 10 years; so, much of what the players desire on their end is a reflection of what’s happened in the other (Big 4 sports) leagues with regards to market cap sharing etc. The competitiveness of the Russian league, the European leagues and the growth of the sport itself has also drawn more of the players’ attention to the game’s financials.*

**Some of the league’s biggest stars (see: Tavares, McDavid, Stamkos) signed front-loaded contracts that have been touted as “lock-out proof”. Are the players prepared financially to withstand a lockout?**

***Harvey****: The concept of “lockout-proof” contracts, that’s all agent driven; it’s a good opportunity for the top players to extract more from the teams up front. The problem of course is the drastic difference in salaries between the best players (Connor McDavid will make $19 million this season as the league’s highest paid player) and the average or low-salary players ($700,000/season is the league minimum). The stars may have contracts that are “lockout-proof”, but most players don’t and the players’ association has to represent the needs and wishes of every player; they can’t be solely representative of the league’s elite players.*

**You mentioned the Russian League (KHL) and some of the European Leagues. Wouldn’t their existence give the players leverage in negotiations?**

***Harvey****: There’s a big gap between the NHL and every other professional hockey league in terms of player compensation. NHL teams have $79.5 million to spend in 2018-2019, KHL teams will have just over $12 million to spend for the 2019-2020 season; it’s not a viable alternative yet, but as those franchises become more valuable it’ll likely become one.*

***Fan Marino***: U.S. Olympic hockey has given sports fans thrills with both amateur/collegiate (see: ’60, ’80) and NHL players (see: T.J. [Oshie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUxJXzKY4LE)), but there’s no question it’s more fun to compete with Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, Russia and Sweden (Big 6) when we send the professionals. The players want to play, but ownership understandably prefers their high price investments not take the additional (2 weeks in middle of season) risk.

The Athletic said that gaining approval to participate in the Olympics is a “must” for the players this time around. **Do you agree with that sentiment?**

***Harvey****: There’s strong interest on the part of Russian players to participate for Russia – and maybe with players from a couple of other countries – but, it isn’t the North American players clamoring to play. The players now participate in the World Championships, which gives them another venue to represent their country. I’m not sure that the whole Olympic thing will be a sticking point in the negotiations.*

And it is not ok. If you look at hit highlights from the 2018 season, half of them are when the guy doesn't have puck posession, and the other half are from behind on the numbers going into a corner. 

The hits in todays NHL look gross compared to the 90's. I remember people talking about head hunting, and yea, it hurts, but what hurts worse is when you have to go into a corner with a guy who will fucking crush you before you even have the puck.

Sometimes Scott Stevens hit late and it looks bad cuz it was open ice, yea... But it has become normal now to wreck a guy in the corner with no puck control, or on his numbers.

I haven't watched NHL in a long time but this is what I've noticed, and I haven't played at top level but at reasonable. What are your guys' thoughts on the hitting these days?",nhl,1548550784,gwaccount88,6,1,True,2019-01-26

I decided to compare each division in their productivity and competitiveness. This isn't a great stat to base anything off of, but I compared the points per game played of each division (points as in 0 for losses, 1 for OTL and 2 for wins).

So starting with the Eastern Conference and All-Star Game winning Metropolitan Division, they have 430pts in 389 games played for an average of 1.1054 ppgp

The Atlantic Division has 448pts in 395 games for an average of 1.1342 ppgp

Now in the Western Conference, the Central Division looks very different because it only has 7 teams. They have 381pts in 349 games for 1.0917ppgp

The pacific has 444pts in a whopping 407 games played (12 more than the Atlantic who has the second most games played). This gives them 1.0909ppgp

In summary, the best ppgp divisions are as follow:

1. Atlantic
2. Metro

I   played for the Vancouver Canucks from 2000-2008 as part of the ""West   Coast Express"" alongside Markus Naslund and Todd Bertuzzi. It was a   tremendous honour to play for  such a great city and to be a part of   such entertaining hockey. Overall I was in the NHL from 1997-2012  playing for such teams as the New Jersey Devils, Anaheim Ducks, Dallas  Stars, Washington Capitals, Calgary Flames and Chicago Blackhawks.

Now I host the TV show ""Reel West Coast"" which is an adventure travel and fishing show currently airing its second season. [Subscribe to us on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/reelwestcoast?sub_confirmation=1) for regular updates.

Looking forward to doing the AMA tomorrow, I'll start a new thread in [r/iama](https://www.reddit.com/r/iama) tomorrow at 7pm to take your questions, in the meantime [check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdwsAZcZwzo) of Willie Mitchell and I getting into a monster halibut from a kayak in Alaska.

Thanks,

Brendan Morrison.",nhl,1549259890,brendan_morrison,0,1,True,2019-02-04

392,Loyalty in sports teams is complete BS,"People who cheer for the same team even when they suck for years and years out of loyalty are just sad.  What are you cheering for?  For decades at a time?  All those people who cheered for the Cubs for 108 years before they finally won, how many people lived their whole lives and died without seeing a championship??  

I don't understand people who cheer for decaded for teams that suck because of loyalty.  If your job sucked this bad would you keep working there or would you move on to a better job.  I don't get this loyalty to crappy teams.  Do you think they care about you or whether you watch, or buy their jerseys.  Even the athletes don't care on those crappy teams.  An anthlete would demand a trade to a contender instead of staying with a crappy team.  So why would you keep cheering for decades for the same loser team???  because of location???  How does a Leafs fan keep cheering for a team that has not won anything or even won a round of the playoffs in 2 decades???  or how are you still a St. Louis Blues fan or Florida Panthers fan or any other crappy team.

I was a Vancouver Canucks fan for 40 years, waited and waited, 3 failed Stanley Cups in 1982, 1994, and 2011, and in 2014 finally fired the team, wasn’t going to wait until I die to see a championship, Burned 7 hockey jerseys, 1 tire cover, 3 flags, 3 mugs and 2 blankets and wrote a long letter to Canucks management and said I would not support their team or buy any more tickets and absolved myself of the team completely, and since then they have gotten worse and my new team the Golden Knights put up 109 points in their first season and I was there for the ride.  

My point is you can always fire your team and get a new team if your team sucks, because I would not want to be that Cubs fan who lived for a 100 years , hoping and praying and never seeing a championship.  Team loyalty is all BS.  If you want to feel sorry for yourself and cheer for a loser team your whole life, go ahead but I would much sooner become a Patriots fan and celebrate with them and enjoy life then be some drab depressed fan because I choose to cheer for loser teams for decades or centuries because of some BS loyality to a team.

401,Fight for your team,"Alright r/nhl, I need your help with something.

As we all know (or as some of us might not know), the NFL completely screwed over both football and SpongeBob fans alike with their halftime show at the Super Bowl. In tandem with that, the Dallas Stars playing Sweet Victory successfully in full at one of their games, and the fact that I've always liked hockey the most out of all sports, I've decided to get back into hockey.

What do I mean by ""get back into""? Well, in terms of sports, I've never really paid much attention to them, outside of a few teams I watched growing up. My grandpa raised me to be a Bears fan, and I'd go with my dad to some baseball and hockey games in Evansville, IN whenever I was visiting, but I never really paid full attention to sports. I did watch the 2018 World Cup, and it was nice to be able to pay attention to a sport and cheer for teams (vive la France!), but I've never really paid attention to anything hockey-related for a while; the last team I kept up with was the Evansville Icemen (now the Jacksonville Icemen), but that was a minor league team, and I've also since stopped visiting my dad (for various reasons). I want a major league team to cheer for, but I also don't want to be a bandwagoning asshole who only cheers for the most recent good team.

With all of that being said, which team do you guys think I should become a fan of? Persuade me to join up with a fanbase, because I'm legitimately curious.",nhl,1549408662,aidand5,15,1,True,2019-02-05

I mean just during gameplay, sometimes trying to make out every player's name and/or number to see who is out there playing together can be difficult. I think that a super imposed rectangle - small, but bold, legible font, placed over their pants and follows them, camera relative all the time.

I’m from Maryland and grew up rooting for the Caps, but moved last May to Las Vegas and adopted the Knights as my full-time team. (I was happy for Ovi and Backstrom) Prior to the move I promised myself I was going to learn more about hockey and the NHL and I have! The Knights were a great entry way to do it and I now know most of the roster. 

But there’s still so much to learn.

Heading into this season I said I was going to learn more about the NHL, players, offensive and defensive philosophies, etc. and then I got an overnight job from November-a few days before Christmas and lost all momentum I had up until that point. I felt like I was so behind on what was going on in the NHL that I gave up on trying to learn and just have been focusing on the Knights, but lately I’ve realized how bummed I am I barely know anything more than when the Knights were first announced to be coming to Vegas. 

SO. 

Please catch me up on the NHL - this season and previous.

I recognize I can Google Stanley Cup winners, league standings, etc. but that doesn’t necessarily tell me all the storylines; including this season. No matter how insignificant or glaringly obvious of a headline, I want to catch up. On the history of the league, its top players, its current top players (I know the big names, but I want to know them all), players that don’t get enough respect, teams on the rise, teams that are rebuilding, exciting prospects (in the league and that are to come), etc. 

TL:DR: I want to know more about the NHL and its history, but am overwhelmed with where to start. Please send me any link to any story, guide, trade, signing, whatever you may think help me. ",nhl,1549490695,alhorfordisanallstar,3,1,True,2019-02-06

Not to mention that this system has the potential to have a team with fewer points not make it into the playoffs at all because each division gets 3 spots no matter what.

175,"Casual NHL fan here, thinking that the NHL should get rid of OTL points.","On a fundamental level, it seems very silly to have some games that produce two points and some games that produce three points. All games should either produce two or three points for a win and ZERO for a loss (regulation or OT). Losing should never be rewarded with HALF the number of points as winning. To me, there is no reason to make a distinction between a team that loses in regulation versus overtime. Your team could win a game and lose a game in regulation, but get the same number of points as a team that loses two games in a row in overtime? Rubbish. 

This rant came from looking at the standings, which look like a mess to me. Wondering what other people think. ",nhl,1545942960,quailrocket,25,1,True,2018-12-27
176,"With Seattle joining the league, how will scheduling work?","I asked this seven months ago, but now with the Seattle Seamen (that will totally be their mascot) officially entering the league as Team 32, the league will have 4 8-team divisions, which will impact the way the scheduling is done, making it squared away across the board.  The current scheduling setup, for those not in the know, is below.

**EASTERN CONFERENCE:**

OPPONENT|SCHEDULE|GAMES
:--|:--|:--
DIVISIONAL OPPONENT| 4 games x 7 opponents| 28 games
CONFERENCE NON-DIVISIONAL OPPONENT| 3 games x 8 opponents| 24 games
NON CONFERENCE OPPONENT OPPONENT| 2 games x 15 opponents| 30 games

**WC CENTRAL DIVISION:**

OPPONENT|SCHEDULE|GAMES
:--|:--|:--
DIVISIONAL OPPONENT| 4 games x 4 opponents, 5 games x 2 opponents| 26 games
CONFERENCE NON-DIVISIONAL OPPONENT| 3 games x 8 opponents| 24 games
NON CONFERENCE OPPONENT OPPONENT| 2 games x 16 opponents| 32 games

**WC PACIFIC DIVISION:**

OPPONENT|SCHEDULE|GAMES
:--|:--|:--
DIVISIONAL OPPONENT| 4 games x 6 opponents, 5 games x 1 opponent| 29 games
CONFERENCE NON-DIVISIONAL OPPONENT| 3 games x 7 opponents| 21 games
NON CONFERENCE OPPONENT OPPONENT| 2 games x 16 opponents| 32 games

The problem is, in its current 82-game state, this would result in a bit of an imbalance regarding the number of times a team plays out-of-division opponents.  In order to maintain an 82-game schedule, it would require each team to play an out-of-conference opponent only once, instead of the usual twice.  Thus, a possible new scheduling row could look like this:

**82 GAME SYSTEM, 32 TEAMS:**

OPPONENT|SCHEDULE|GAMES
:--|:--|:--
DIVISIONAL OPPONENT| 4 games x 7 opponents| 28 games
CONFERENCE NON-DIVISIONAL OPPONENT| 3 games x 8 opponents| 24 games
NON CONFERENCE OPPONENT OPPONENT| 2 games x 14 opponents, 1 game x 2 opponents | 30 games

However, I personally think a return to the 84-game schedule would be the best fit.  The 84-game schedule was used for two seasons (92-93, 93-94) when the league had fewer teams, after which it went down to 48 for a shortened season, and then to the current 82.  There was no need to have a full 84 games, so it felt natural.  Now, with the addition of Team 32, it feels like 84 is the natural round number to use, because it makes the scheduling far easier, as seen below.

**84 GAME SYSTEM, 32 TEAMS:**

OPPONENT|SCHEDULE|GAMES
:--|:--|:--
DIVISIONAL OPPONENT| 4 games x 7 opponents| 28 games
CONFERENCE NON-DIVISIONAL OPPONENT| 3 games x 8 opponents| 24 games
NON CONFERENCE OPPONENT OPPONENT| 2 games x 16 opponents| 32 games

Some concerns I've seen in the past include the season being enough of a war of attrition as it is, not to mention the extra injury risk among other things.

I remember a stretch of 2 seasons where they went to the playoffs and they got bounced by the redwings both times. It was extremely annoying and it made me hate players like Datsyuk,Zetterberg,and Lidstrom. I was finally happy when they got realigned to the east and thought the coyotes would be able to possibly get to the cup final. Then in the 2011-2012 season they lost to the kings in the conference final and it made me more mad because the kings were an 8th seed. Then after that all hell broke loose and they haven’t made the playoffs since. The team has been terrible since and hasn’t been drafting well either due to missing out on generational talents in recent years like mcdavid, Arizona born Matthews, and even Elias Petterson. Now look Clayton Keller has been decent and isn’t at the bust level of strome, Peter mueller, or mark visentin but he isn’t panning out how thought. Unless the coyotes get Jack Hughes I don’t see Arizona becoming better in the short time future. So my question is if dvorak, Barrett hayton,Adin hill, and whatever future prospects the coyotes acquire pan out will they even have a possibility for just making it to the playoffs in even my lifetime ?",nhl,1545968193,01010101010o10101001,22,1,True,2018-12-27
182,New Point System I Experimented With,"Been growing tired of the current point system where some games are worth 2 points and some are worth 3. I've also grown tired of the novelty of shootouts and miss the days of ties. I know a lot of people in the current generation have grown up with a lot of soccer and wouldn't mind them either so I've tried to create a system in which all games are worth 3 points except games which end in a tie after a 5 minute 3-on-3 overtime period (thus punishing both teams with 2 dropped points), thus increasing the value of points and regulation wins.
This would also solve issues like discrepancies in the standings that show certain teams looking better than they really are (for example, teams like the 2017-18 Calgary Flames that show a somewhat competitive, above .500, 37-35-10 record, even though they lost 45 games and only won 37). It feels to me like the league is rewarding mediocrity and punishing dominance.

The system would go W(3pts)-OTW(2pts)-L(0pts)-OTL/T(1pt)

What I did find with this system when running it through the 2017-18 standings was pretty interesting:

**EASTERN CONFERENCE**
*Metropolitan Division*
WSH 38-8-26-10 / 140 (M1)
PIT 33-12-29-8 / 131 (M2)
PHI 31-9-26-16 / 127 (M3)

*Pacific Division*
VGK 39-8-24-11 / 144 (P1)
ANA 35-5-25-17 / 132 (P2)
SJ 35-5-27-15 / 130 (P3)
LA 34-9-29-10 / 130 (WC1)

VAN 25-6-40-11 / 98
EDM 24-7-40-11 / 97
ARI 20-7-41-14 / 88

One thing I noticed last season was that despite Florida picking up a lot of regulation and blow out wins down the stretch, they couldn't gain any ground on Columbus and New Jersey despite their far less dominant wins often ending in overtime or shootouts (in fact if they were placed in the Metro, with this system they would have placed 2nd ahead of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia); the ROW tiebreaker can only do so much-- this system's tiebreaker being regulation wins. I do feel this system allows a truer standings and encourages a more offensive style of play to gain that extra point for a regulation win and avoids delusions general managers whose teams are well off of being a contender thinking they're only a couple pieces away from being put over the top because they finished only a few points behind a playoff team because two losses = a win.
On top of that the playoff matchups would have switched up accordingly:

**EAST**
*A1* Boston^(150pts)
*WC2* New Jersey^(125pts)

*A2* Tampa Bay^(149pts)
*A3* Toronto^(135pts)

*M1* Washington^(140pts)
*WC1* Florida^(131pts)

*M2* Pittsburgh^(131pts)
*M3* Philadelphia^(127pts)

**WEST**
*C1* Winnipeg^(153pts)
*WC2* Colorado^(128pts)

*C2* Nashville^(153pts)
*C3* Minnesota^(136pts)

*P1* Vegas^(144pts)
*WC1* Los Angeles^(130pts)

*P2* Anaheim^(132pts)
*P3* San Jose^(130pts)

So does anyone agree that this would make for a good switch for the NHL or are there any major flaws here that someone can point out which would make this not work?",nhl,1545982436,TT_ryan,10,1,True,2018-12-28

His previous career-high goals was 14 in 78 games last season, which doubled his prior career-high of 7 in 82 from both of the years before. He is, accordingly, quite likely to set a new career high this year (provided he doesnt get himself suspended forever before he can).

He has, in his 18 games, climbed to around 60th in the NHL in PIMs. He's typically around the league leaders in the stat, peaking at 187 last season. His ~1.7 PIM per game so far this year is a lot lower than last year's 2.4, despite more ice time, but is still pretty high and on the low end of the range his PIM/game have spanned over the last few years, not completely out of the norm.

299,Anyone think Ovechkin should get a harsher punishment for missing the All Star game?,"I don’t the All-Star games - I think they are gimmicky and see no real entertainment value. The skills competition can be somewhat interesting for me but the game portion, in my opinion, is a waste.  

However, I certainly understand the value of All-Star weekends.  They are events for the fans. They give greater access to the games rising and established stars and offer fans an opportunity to see the game’s best enjoy some light spirited hockey. The entire premise is fan appreciation which is appropriate given the player’s salaries are entirely dependant on the fans. Ticket sales, advertising, merchandise sales, and tv viewership are all avenues which make the NHL, teams, and players their money. With no fans in the stands or watching on TV there would be no professional hockey league. 

To that end, Ovechkin is skipping an event designed for the fans. Moreover, he decided to skip knowing and fully accepting the one game suspension from the league, which obviously indicates one game is neither a deterrent or a serious determining factor in his attendance.

I don’t like or watch the All Star weekend so I don’t care whether or not he is there, but someone does...

Some kid wants to see Ovi, some parent will need to explain it to their son or daughter that he isn’t showing up. I think there should be a longer suspension, a fine, or the suspension of a meaningful game (like a playoff game) to have the players evaluate their participation.

They are being paid because people like to watch hockey...I think there should be more accountability. ",nhl,1546568594,_KelVarnsen_,14,1,True,2019-01-03

305,Out-There Idea for new All-Star Format which builds on a classic format...,"This is my out-there idea which is actually a re-hash of the first all-star game with a big twist for fans...

The All-Star game returns to the NHL All-Stars vs Stanley Cup Champions with the Champions being the road team (thus still allowing the venue, and NHL jersey, to change every year.) The game returns to a standard one-off 60-minute 5-on-5 exhibition game. 

Here's the modern twist: To add depth to the Stanley Cup Champion (who presumably shouldn't need too much), the franchise can select up to 10 players from around the NHL to join their roster for the game, but with one caveat: The player must have played at least 41 regular season games for the team at some point in his career... 


Hence this years game rosters could be*:
All-Stars: 
McDavid (Edmonton), Crosby (Pittsburgh), Kucherov (Tampa), Gaudreau (Calgary), Keller (Phoenix), Kane (Chicago), O'Reilly (St. Louis), Barzal (NYI), Matthews (Toronto), Pastrnak (Boston), Eichel (Buffalo), Garnlund (Minnesota) 

Doughty (Los Angeles), Burns (San Jose), Jones (Columbus), Chabot (Ottawa), Yandle, (Florida), Heiskanen (Dallas) 

Price (Montreal), Lunqvist (NYR), Rinne (Nashville)


Washington Capitals: 
Backstrom, Ovechkin, Oshie, Wilson, Kuznetsov, Connolly, Eller, Vrana, Beagle (Vancouver), Johansson (New Jersey), Williams (Carolina), Perreault (Winnipeg)

Carlson, Niskanen, Kempny, Orlov, Schmidt (Las Vegas), Green (Detroit)

Holtby, Varlamov (Colorado), Neuvirth (Philadelphia)

 *these rosters are for displays purposes only, feel free to hate on the format, hating on the selections is a waste of time, i just threw in as many names as possible as quickly as possible

Obviously everyone but the Champs only get one player, and, yeah, Arizona and Anaheim got screwed, but i also only used 8 of the 10 allotments allowed for the current champs... so i imagine the biggest problem with this plan is getting at least one player from every team. 

Please feel free to hate on the idea? Or improve one it, i really just want an All-star game i feel like watching and my theory was this: The fans of the team that won the cup get the pleasure of seeing a few fellow players wear their jersey again... and everyone else hopefully will get to watch the rest of the NHL pummel that jersey mercilessly.

Oh, and the Skills Competition would remain all-stars vs ALL the champs, so the ""marginal"", but valuable players, like Devante Smith-Pelly are still going to be a part of the festivities. ",nhl,1546621604,quirkymuse,7,1,True,2019-01-04

NHL still have fans from so many countries and not only North America. I’ve seen NHL as neutral in questions like these. Even the picture is only of the ”devasted Americans”, none of the Finns cheering. NHL should be more neutral than that, shouldn’t it? I am wondering if it could be because you can change the NHL-website to your language if you want to, and this is maybe written as if only Americans and Canadians would read it and that perhaps Finns, Swedes and such would have a totally different article focusing on their players. Is that so? I haven’t checked that, so I don’t know. Even so, British fans for example would have this version to read, as well as others whose language don’t exist on the NHL webpage.

395,3 pts ranking system,"Hi everyone, 
I wrote a paper a few years ago on how the new ranking system (the subdivision of the conferences) changed the ranking dynamics to enter the playoffs. 
Now that I recently joined reddit, I would like to have your opinion on the subject, and especially what you think of a system in which a win in 60 minutes is worth 3 points, a win in OT/SO 2 pts, a loss in OT/SO 1 pts and 0 pt otherwise. 
IIRC, I've found that it helped against weaker division team accessing the playoffs when better could not because of their own division being stronger. I did not, however (and obviously) solved the problem that it is not the 16 best team that are participating in the 'spring dance', which is inherent from the geographical division. 

One (funny) thing I remembered though was that the year I did this research, the Habs finished 1st in the eastern conference with a bit more that 100 pts and 4th overall (IIRC) but under the 3 pts system they weren't 1st and 7th or 8th overall! ",nhl,1547157431,swqdea,2,1,True,2019-01-10

attacking zone is tripped or otherwise fouled with no opposition between him and the opposing goal, thus preventing a reasonable scoring opportunity, the Referee shall immediately stop play and award a goal to the attacking team.

For anyone who knows my stepfather, Darcy, they know he’s an avid Toronto Maple Leafs fan. He has loved them since he was a little kid.

Unfortunately, my stepfather was diagnosed with non-small cell carcinoma in March (lung cancer). His cancer is stage 3, almost stage 4. He has been given a 20 to 30% chance of survival. His number one wish is to go and watch a Toronto Maple Leafs hockey game and meet the players.

Recently, he finished an aggressive round of chemotherapy and radiation, which the tumour didn’t respond to. He is now going for a treatment called immunotherapy, and if this doesn’t work, there’s nothing else that can be done. My biggest wish this Christmas is to get my stepfather and his sons to a Leafs game.

Some other interesting notes:

\-Jason Garrison scored the first 3-on-3 OT goal, for the Lightning against the Flyers

\-Jonathan Toews scored the first road 3-on-3 OT goal, for the Blackhawks against the Islanders

\-All of the Blue Jackets 2016-17 OT goals were scored by American players (and they had quite a few)

\-The Minnesota Wild didn't score their first 3-on-3 OT goal at home until February 27, 2017, more than a year after its institution

\-The Montreal Canadiens had only 1 OT/SO win at home during the 2016-17 season, scored in OT by Alex Galchenyuk against the Blue Jackets

\-The Los Angeles Kings went more than a season between 3-on-3 OT losses at home, losing only to the Devils during the 2015-16 season and then to the Flames during the 2017-18 season

\-The New York Rangers didn't have an OT win or loss at home during the 2016-17 season; all of their extra period games at MSG went to a SO (and none of their playoff games went into OT either, to make it even more weird)

\-Brad Marchand scored 5 OT goals during the 2017-18 season (please check me on this)

\-I couldn't help but realize how good some players were in 3-on-3 OT. While I can't name them all, two players that really stood out to me were Mike Hoffman and Leon Draisaitl.

\-I think Bruce Boudreau may be one of the worst coaches to have for 3-on-3: he's 14-22 in stints for Anaheim and Minnesota (which happen to be two of the worst 3-on-3 teams).

\-On March 6, 2018, Jonathan Toews scored an OT goal at home versus the Avalanche: that was the first such goal for the Blackhawks against the Avalanche in the 24 year history of that rivalry.

\-Jonathan Toews also scored 2 3-on-3 OT goals in consecutive 1-0 wins for the Blackhawks, against the Lightning and then the Ducks

The fights is all but gone from the game entirely and players seems to get smaller by the minute. We need to get some toughness back in the league. Bring up some 4th liners who brings energy but can also drop the gloves. Just keep it clean. No headshots and shit like that. The rivalries will eventually die out if the physical play stops.

331,Expansion/Relocated team success since the 90s,"The expansion teams are some of my favorites to watch, so I ranked each expansion/relocated team's success (all that happened since the start of the 90s.) Since dynamics often change drastically with a move, I've separated teams like the Thrashers and Jets.

In order from worst to best:

Atlanta Thrashers: when you have to relocate to a different city just 12 years after inception, that's just...not good

Florida Panthers: look, I get they had an amazing run in the 90s to the SC, but if you add together the whole picture you get a factory of misery

Columbus Blue Jackets: this decade has been much better than the previous, but they're the only team still seeking a playoff series win and have still sucked for the majority of their existence

Arizona Coyotes: the NHLs ""wonderful"" desert experiment has gone as expected outside of one sick run to the WCF in 2012 (their only ever playoff series wins)

Winnipeg Jets: this one's got the biggest potential to change for the better, but a mostly lackluster 2011-2017 still hurts (at least the hockey improved from Atlanta)

Minnesota Wild: we're getting into average territory now. The Wild have had good years, but I docked several points for being first and second round punching bags (outside of 2003) and being a significant downgrade from the North Stars

Nashville Predators: more or less the same as the Wild being first and second round punching bags, though their 2017 SC run puts them just ahead of Minnesota

Ottawa Senators: probably the most average team on this list. They've always been the good, sometimes great but not excellent enough team. 2007 was sort of an exception, but they got bounced pretty easily by the Ducks

San Jose Sharks: very frequent trips to the playoffs and a nice 2016 SC run. They're great in the regular season, but I must say as an honest Sharks fan that this team handles adversity the worst of any team in the NHL. They're one of the worst teams when trailing by 2 or more goals and possibly the most uninspired in elimination games. Did you know that in 2017 against the Hurricanes they had their first 3 goal regular season comeback ever? Just proving my point that this team literally just gives up when things get just a little more difficult from them (case and point: watch the last 3 years when they were eliminated in a Game 6). OK, my rant is over.

Carolina Hurricanes: entering cup territory now. Really enjoyed this team's 2006 championship, sadly other than some sporadic success in other years this team has really been quite mediocre

Tampa Bay Lightning: things have really looked up in recent years thanks to Yzerman, and who can forget their 2004 win? However, the Lightning still have a low overall win-loss percentage

Dallas Stars: This team was super good in the beginning with guys like Hull and Modano (1999 SC win), then became average, and now are struggling like hell. The good old days keeps them this high up

Colorado Avalanche: the best relocated team in this bunch. Very fun to watch in the beginning, with guys like Roy and Sakic doing amazing things and winning two SCs for Denver. They're getting better again but since 2008 it's been mostly crappy (getting better again though).

Anaheim Ducks: the most consistently good team in the bunch over the years IMO. You gotta give it to them as an expansion franchise. They also have the highest win loss record of any franchise on this list.

And what about the Vegas Golden Knights? Honestly, I'm not too optimistic they can maintain their initial success. Their grade is incomplete for now, but if you're like me, their initial run was more of a hot streak than actual substance. I can only hope for Vegas fans that they don't catch Florida Panther syndrome and experience endless mediocrity from here on out.",nhl,1543402758,displacedindavis,0,1,True,2018-11-28

From [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season_structure_of_the_NHL)

&gt;One Western Conference exception is that one team from each division plays one less game inside Division and one more game inside Conference but outside their Division. Teams rotate every season. The schedule is structured so that every NHL team plays in every arena at least once per season. The San Jose Sharks and Colorado Avalanche played each other 4 times in 2013–14 and 2015–16, but only twice in 2014–15 and 2016–17 in favour of 5 games against all their divisional opponents.

How come they played each other 2 times in 14-15 and 16-17? Shouldn’t they have played 3, since it’s conference outside division? 

Also, does that mean that they played 4 games inside division to every team, and no 5 game team?

So my question: Can we play couch co-op style (three of us playing, against AI) online? It would be two people at one house, and myself at mine. I know you can play with a bunch of online people, but we’d prefer just the three of us versus the computer if possible.

449,Long time NHL fan disinterested in watching hockey anymore,"I have followed and watched NHL hockey for 40 years now but I have lost all interest in it now and don't feel like watching it anymore.  The game has changed so much, and I don't enjoy it anymore.  I knew this day was coming the day 30 years ago when they decided to eliminate the red line from the game.  It has made the game faster but less exciting.

It's now like watching a tennis match, one team zooms up the ice, tic tac toe, then back the other way.  Because the game is faster collisions were more violent, so the NHL started throwing the book on hitters in the game, so now essntially there is no hitting, fighting is also gone and the general hate and rivalries are gone from hockey.  

NHL hockey today is like watching a ringette match, or a curling tournament.  Well I loved hockey for the big hits ""Stevens on Lindros""  ""Stevens on Kariya"" the big brawls ""Colorado and Detroit"", the big fights, the general hate on for the other teams.  Those games were exciting to watch, but in todays NHL opposing team mates hug it out before games and nobody hits anyone anymore..

Hockey has become a sissy tennis match now, back and forth, it's like basketball, back and forth.

Well you got your wish sissy millenials, you have your lame hockey now, but I'm out.  Can't follow a sport that has changed so much.  Now you can be a scrawny 5'9 player in the game, in the old days only real men over 6 feet played the game, as you had to survive the punishing hits in the corner,  be able to fight and games were exciting with big hits, fights and goals were a bonus..

I can't watch hockey today, it's soooo boring now, there is absolutely no excitement in the game.  I think I would rather watch paint dry now.  So I'm done watching hockey, it's no different than watching a soap opera now.  Goodbye NHL,  After 40 years you have lost me as a fan

134,NHL Cards question,"Okay, I got a huge card collection last night. Mainly baseball with some NFL and NHL cards scattered in there.

Most of the NHL cards are from late 70s to early 80s.

Have a couple of questions because I am not a hockey person in the least. Now, I do know some of the big names like Orr, Hull, Gretzky, Lemeiux, Bourque....and that's about all.

First question is, for the 1979/80 Topps set, they have fold-out ""placemats"" for the teams. WTF? What were they thinking? And why didn't the make one for all teams?
Would have been nice to have an Oilers one with Gretzky in it.
Also, are these worth anything. I have about 40 or so in mint shape.

Secondly, what the hell is with these cards and the scratch off names for the players?

Thirdly, I was able to pull a couple of Gretzky's from there. 1979/80 Topps Scoring Leaders #163. Mint condition. One scratched off and the other not scratched off.
1979/80 Gretzky All Star 2nd team card #87, mint condition.
3x 1980/81 Oilers team card with Gretzky on it. Mint condition for all.
Are these worth much?

Also, in the 1980/81 set, I got like 5 Ray Bourque rookie cards, all in mint condition. Value?

They worked their tail off in the playoffs to get the cup and I was really impressed with that team. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the summer, the NHL covers the cup champions a lot and automatically classify them as favorites to win it again next year. This summer, I feel like the NHL REALLY wants to move on from the Caps winning it for some reason. Barely any coverage in my opinion other than days with the cup.

I've written a guide on Yahoo! Fantasy Hockey Drafting.  I've played since early years of high school and thought it was due time to share the tips I believe are most important.

Above is the link... I'd certainly be happy to bring the price down from $5.99 -- I just want to help out everyone who wants to learn or improve. Below are the chapters and some text excerpts.

Chapter 2: Tweaking the Yahoo! Fantasy Hockey Draft Interface for Player Researching
The specific draft interface shown below is how your interface should be when you’re drafting, because it makes it very easy to research and find which players to pick.

Instructions to Modify the Interface, and How to Research Players With it
1.	First, click the drop-down arrow where it says “All Players.” Then select “All Players / Defenseman.”  I put a blue oval on the drop-down list, towards the top right corner of the picture, to make it easier for you to see.   This drop down will also give you the option of seeing the best available players for every position: RW, LW, D, Goalie.

Concepts of ‘A Well-Rounded Team’

A championship-bound fantasy hockey team must be a ‘well-rounded team’ – and by well-rounded, I mean:
1.	You must have at least one elite player for every position on your roster: center (C), right wing (RW), left wing (LW), defense (D), and goalie (G) – this way you have no deficiencies, and accordingly don’t have to worry about consistently inadequate performance in any particular weekly scoreboard category.

•	Example: you should draft the top available player on your first pick (McDavid, Ovechkin, Kucherov). Say, for instance, you draft Ovechkin (LW) with your first pick – your second and third pick should either be a RW or a Center.

On top of the experts saying this, they are also not giving Florida the respect they deserve. It can be argued that the addition of Hoffman makes the Panthers top 6 the best in the NHL.

What team should I root for?,"So, I've been thinking about getting into hockey for a while, but I'm the type of person that really needs a team to follow in order to get into the sport. So I'm looking for some help. Here's a couple of things about what I'm looking for, any help would be appreciated!

1. I'd prefer a team on the East Coast and in the US. For reference, I root for the Phillies in baseball and the Giants in football, so I'm not specific to a city, but the general area would be a plus.
2. I'm looking for a fan base that's knowledgeable about the sport and expects their team to be good, but that isn't overly nasty about it.
3. My wife roots for the Flyers and Penguins (I know, she doesn't understand rivalries). I've been to a couple of Flyers games and I find that fan base not super friendly (no offense to anybody here), so I don't know if either of these teams meets my needs the best.
4. If there's a team that's overly dominant, I find that boring. I like a good underdog, but expect my team to be competitive.",nhl,1534383869,storyworthtelling,55,9,True,2018-08-15

Unless the Devils voluntarily released any rights to him, it seems like an incredible abuse of the rules that he just returns a few years later and signs with a different team with no complications.

Warm weather and attention to other sports has kept me away. Buuuut this year I've decided not to get NBA league pass and instead jump into hockey. The NBA has frankly become boring, I'll still root for my Thunder, but other games have turned sour for me, everyone knows whats going to happen, the Warriors are gonna fool around and win 65 games, and then beat the living crap out of everyone in the playoffs and win again. It's like skipping to the end of a book, just kinda ruins the season for me. So I need something to fill the void.

As such I've decided now is as good a time as any to make a leap into ice sport, knowing next to nothing about the teams or the league. I figure there's a league pass alternative that I can get as well. 

Here is where I need y'all's help. I figure watching and keeping up with the whole league would be ridiculous and overwhelming for an unfrosted newbie.

107,Holtby&gt;Price,"Holtby &gt; Price  no not because of a cup.

Their career regular season save percentage and GAA is very close but holtby holds a slight edge in both(2.41 GAA to 2.45 , save percentage holtby has the edge literally by .001)

However in the playoffs Holtby has the edge in GAA 2.04 (Holtby has one of the best playoff GAA among active goalies) to Prices 2.53.  Also has more playoff shutouts despite less appearences. Holtbys worst postseason(2017) His GAA was still under the league average 

 On the other hand Price  has 3 postseasons well above league average in GAAand 3 postseasons with a Save percentage under .900

Yes I know price has had some bad teams around him however some of these playoff performances by a elite goalie is inexcusable. That’s the difference between the elite and just the good. Holtby and Price are very close but the difference is that holtby steps his game up in the postseason to a elite level. Despite his poor performance last year I still consider him elite I’m simply arguing that holtby is better.

176,"Why no Canadian NHL team will win the Stanley Cup, here is why","Gary Bettman who is the commissioner of the National Hockey League (NHL) was brought in 30 years ago with one agenda, and that was to grow the game of hockey in the USA.  In Canada the game of hockey is like a religion, with winters lasting 6 months all there is, is hockey.  Fans are passionate and it's the number one sport.  Football and baseball come second and third.  Unfortunately for fans in Canada, no Canadian NHL team has won the Stanley Cup for 25 years since the Montreal Canadians have won.

This thesis will explain why no Canadian team will win the Stanley Cup until at least 2050.

Gary Batman's job is to grow the game in the USA, there are currently 24 NHL teams in the USA and 7 in Canada. With expansion more and more teams have started in American cities, Ice hockey teams in Florida, Panthers and Lightning,  in the desert with Phoenix and Las Vega, other warm places such as Dallas, LA, Anaheim, San Jose,  these are warm climate cities who now have ice rinks.  The people there don't really care about hockey, they are more interested in football, basketball and baseball, yet they have ice hockey teams.  Why, because Gary Bettman wants them there, because that's his #1 mission, grow the game in the USA.  The NHL is a billion dollar industry and with the USA population being 10 times larger then the Canadian population the potential for money revenue is greater in the USA even though the interest is not there.

Now with the weaning attendance in places like Florida and Phoenix, how do you attract more fans?  By having winning teams, nobody is going to go see a loser team if they don't really want to see a game in the first place.  So you have to create attraction, excitement, what better way then by winning, making the playoffs and winning the ultimate trophy, the Stanley Cup.  Now in Canada people will watch hockey no matter what.  In Toronto people will pay $500 per seat for a team that has not won a Stanley Cup in 51 years!!!, yet every night the arena is sold out.  You don't need to win, people will still come, they have for 51 years.

In 1993 we had the chance to see the Montreal Canadians and the Toronto Maple Leafs play in the final for the Stanley Cup, now this would have been a huge loss of revenue in the USA as why would the Americans care about two Canadian teams,  Wayne Gretzky was still fresh in LA, the game was being grown in the LA market, with celebrities, Hollywood, billions of dollars on the line.

So what happened, in the last 5 minutes of the game between LA and Toronto,  Wayne Gretzky high sticked a Toronto player Doug Gilmour in the face, there was a cut, there was blood, in the rules that's a 5 minute automatic penalty, but guess what it was never called,  the game ended up going into overtime and Gretzky scored the overtime winner and LA magically went on into the finals to play for the Cup.  This would also be the last year a Canadian team won the Stanley Cup.

Now you might say how can the NHL control the outcome of games, simple answer, the referees work for the NHL, they control the penalties, goals called back, they are the judges of the games.  They can influence a game in any direction they choose.  Take the 1999 Stanley Cup finals between Dallas and Buffalo, all season that year the rule was if any part of an offensive player is in the blue ice of the goalie crease when the puck goes into the net, the goal will be disallowed for obstruction of the goalie.  26 goals were called back in 1999 playoffs because someone's skate was in the crease, even if it was just a skate lace in the crease, no goal.  Yet the famous Stanley Cup winning goal scored by Brett Hull from Dallas that year clearly shows his whole leg in the crease while he is shoveling the puck into the net to win the cup.  The goal should have been disallowed as per the rules, yet it stood and Dallas won the cup.  The Stars coincidentally just moved to Dallas from Minnesota 5 years earlier and nobody was watching their games in hot Dallas, so what better way to attract new fans than by winning the Stanley Cup.  And who decided that, the NHL, through their referees who let the goal stand that should have been disallowed.

Canada has had 4 of their 7 teams in the Stanley Cup finals in the last 20 years yet none of them have won the cup

2004  Calgary vs Tampa, yep Tampa won
2006  Edmonton vs Carolina, yep Carolina won
2007  Ottawa vs  Anaheim,  yep Anaheim won
2011  Vancouver vs Boston , yep  Boston won

In 2015-2016 season, no Canadian team even made the playoffs.

The game still has a lot of growing in the USA, and Gary will make sure those teams are winning the Stanley Cups south of the border with Canada.  And he has his referees to make sure it happens.

Incidentally I predict that Las Vegas will win the Stanley Cup in the next 4 years, I know it's the desert, who cares about ice and hockey, is there even an arena in Las Vegas?  But imagine the excitement of a Stanley Cup final right there in Vegas,  all the celebrities can fly down from Hollywood, you have the casinos and the main event, just like when they hold the boxing matches there.

I can just see the dollar signs spinning in Gary Bettman's eyes.  Way to go Gary 25 years with no Cup in Canada and 25 more to go.  Sorry Canadian citizens and fans, after all the NHL is a billion dollar business, it's all about the money, but keep cheering maybe this year Winnipeg might have a shot (not)  they will be out by round 2 like the Leafs.

184,I FIRED my favorite NHL team and I have no regrets.,"Four years ago after the Canucks disappointing loss to the Flames I had finally reached my limit of waiting, hoping and praying for the Canucks to win a Stanley Cup.  After 44 years of waiting I have finally had enough.  I packed away my 9 hockey jerseys, 4 hats, tire cover, 2 flags and 2 blankets into a box and said this is enough waiting.

I do not want to be one of those fans that waits their whole life to see their team try to win the ultimate prize.  Life is too short for that.  You can only hear  ""we are rebuilding"" so many times in your lifetime.  I have already dedicated 44 years to this team,  I did not want to be like a Leafs fan who is waiting for 50 years for their team to even reach the finals or how about a Chicago Cubs fan, there was not one alive who had seen them win a World Series, it's was 108 years for them!!.  

Nope I wasn't going to be one of those fans who gets swayed by the media and the hype to cheer on their team every start of the season,  hockey is a business and as long as fans come and pay and watch and buy the $17.00 beers and pay $700 for a pair of platinum seats the hype will be there.  Unfortunately for me I couldn't justify watching a losing team for those kind of prices and hype.  

Simple math will show us that the Canucks will not win a Stanley Cup until 2031 possibly.

First Stanley Cup appearance  1970 - 1981    11 years waiting
Second Stanley Cup appearance  1981 - 1994  13 years waiting
Third Stanley Cup appearance   1994 - 2011   17 years waiting
Possible Fourth appearance    2011 - 2031    20 years waiting

I'm sorry but I'm not willing to wait until 2031 to maybe see the Canucks win the Stanley Cup,  I will not be a Chicago Cubs fan who had to wait for 108 years.  I'm an athlete myself and a competitor and I play to win and not just to have fun and I expect my hockey team to win also, unfortunately 44 years without winning was too long to wait.  So this was my official good bye letter to Vancouver management, Trevor Linden and everyone else in Canucks Nation. I was not going to be a loser fan like a Leafs, Cleveland Indians or a Cubs fans who waited for 108 years.

I didn't follow hockey for 4 years, I had no team, but I missed the game, I play 3 times a week and wanted to have a team to cheer for.  So when I heard that Las Vegas was getting an NHL team, I immediately decided that this would be my favorite team for life now.  I flew down the first week of the season, watched 2 games, loved it, got a new Vegas jersey and hat, license plate cover and I didn't care if the team didn't do well in their inaugural season, well to my excitement they went all the way to the Stanley Cup Finals!!  So I have no regrets switching teams, incidentally the Vancouver Canucks have only gotten worse the last 4 years.

Sometimes change is good, also no Canadian team is going to win the Cup for another 25 years so I'm glad I fired my old team.

I fired my team and I have no regrets!!

I can't find this fit hat anywhere and I have looked on NHL site,Lids,champs etc. I don't care the team I just want a hat that fits similar to this and can't find it anywhere....

I remember seeing players wear these after winning the Stanley cup or there conference finals.

The newer hockey hats are more shaped like baseball hats with shorter visors and bigger heads which are on NHL.com.

Any help is appreciated!!!

422,Vladimir Tarasenko or Artemi Panarin?,"Looking at their past 3 seasons, as I think it’s unfair to devalue Tarasenko in this comparison with his first 3 seasons ages 21-23 while Panarin was not even in the league:


Regular season:

Tarasenko scored 112 G, 103 A, for 215 P in 242 games. 27 G, 35 A, for 62 PPP. ATOI 18:43. 99 TK &amp; 97 GV. + 21.
Panarin scored 88 G, 145 A, for 233 P in 243 games. 24 G, 38 A, for 62 PPP. ATOI 19:23. 156 TK &amp; 141 GV. +49.

Postseason:
Tarasenko scored 12 G, 9 A, for 21 P in 31 games. 2 G, 8 A, for 10 PPP. ATOI 19:26. 11 TK &amp; 11 GV. -3.

Panarin scored 4 G, 11 A, for 15 P in 17 games. 0 G, 6 A, for 6 PPP. ATOI 22:23. 15 TK &amp; 5 GV. -6.



Before I compared their stats I was leaning towards Tarasenko, and while I believe his scoring touch goes a long way, I’m now inclined to say Panarin. I thought Tarasenko would be deadlier on the PP but their stats are almost exactly identical there. Tarasenko only starts in the defensive zone 5.6% more often and a 24 G difference doesn’t overshadow the 42 A differential especially when Panarin is posting 30 G seasons.

Any opinions or reasons you might think Tarasenko is the better player?",nhl,1533861266,why-is-hockey,12,2,True,2018-08-09

Two   months ago, I compiled a ""vaguely scientific"" ranking of close to 100   players. Some of you asked for an updated version shortly before the   draft. I just completed this updated version, and I present it to you in   the below link.

I   have reviewed 12 of   the most respected rankings. Five of those were   top-31 rankings,  while  the other 7 evaluated more players, usually 100.

The     players in my ranking are divided into logical classes. I explain  the   criteria for belonging to each class at the end of this post.  Within  each class, players are ranked by their highest average ranking  (for the  12 rankings I have included).

I hope this comes handy this weekend!

404,The Big NHL Debate,"Lately a controversial issue has been taking the league by storm, it is the hot button issue of ""should the league ban gay people"" and in this I will point out why they should and why gay people are inferior the straight people
1.) Gay people's legs will be weakened from anal sex

 Obviously sex is a rigourous task but getting pounded would surely weaken ur leg muscles resulting in an underwhelming preformance

2.) Gay people are born that way 

  We do not let other mentally disabled people play in the league, so why should we let gays? They can't help their mental illness. I myself used to thing being gay was a choice but then I realized there's gotta be something wrong with you if you wanna get fucked in the ass. 

3.) Gay people will divide the locker room

Some players might feel uncomfortable being around gay people and what would Sidney Crosby do? Obviously gay people won't be able to control themselves around him

4.) We don't need a pansy league. 

  Gay people are much more feminine than straight people. We don't need them pansying up the league.

So in short gay people are inferior to straight people and I agree with many of the other league officials pushing to ban gay people. Please leave thoughts below. ",nhl,1530745511,MortarTakesSkill,6,0,True,2018-07-04

Would you still root for your team if they announced a new uniform something like the above? Full pads and equipment would go underneath of course, but they would be the first teams to don a dress as a uniform.

Similarly to the Cooperalls uniforms worn by the Flyers and Whalers in the 80s, they would be unique in the league with this bold new step. Many fans of those teams hated the cooperalls, but as far as I know they didn't stop cheering for them. Would this cross a line? Do NHL fans have limits on what on-ice product they will root for? Would it catch on if the dress team won a cup? Would on-ice performance affect the support?

Would you buy one and wear it to support your team?

447,offseason boredom: Career Time On Ice Leader(since the stat was tracked) Among active players,"Not to be confused with average time on ice, I needed to know who has the most time on ice, period. Who has spent the most time playing NHL hockey?

First, the methodology: This will be a highly contested stat, since some great players started playing before TOI and ATOI was tracked in the begining of the 97/98 season. Therefore, out of respect for the greats that came before the stat, this will be limited to active players. Playoffs included, exhibition excluded. Let's begin.

First, an honorable mention: With his NHL career nearing it's end, and future uncertain, Jaromir Jagr is getting royally screwed in this stat. Having played 7 full seasons since the start of toi, he's left with  27294:49 minutes of documented time on ice. Although that may seem impressive, it does not break the top 5. He may, just may, have the most time on ice among active players, if he is indeed still active, but far too much uncertainty comes with estimating 7 seasons of gameplay. Giving him the benefit of the doubt, let's add number of games\*career atoi= 504 games@20:19 per game=10,246:20, bringing his total to 37540:24. If true, Jagr would solidly park his ass in second place. Unfortunately, there is no way of knowing, therefore he gets an honorable mention for being a hardcore dinosaur that forgot more about hockey than most fans will ever know.

At number 5: With 28,210:48 minutes of game play,  Jay Bouwmeester has racked up quite a few minutes in his 15 year career. His impressive atoi of 24:26 is the highest among the top 5 in this list, as well as his career +245.  If the leader retired now, he would have to play that average time for another 427 games to catch the number one player.

Number 4: Jerome Iginla is currently an unempoloyed nhl player that has amassed 30,434:35 documented minutes, plus 1 undocumented season in which he played 82 games. Unfortunately, that season would have to have been played by jerome in it's entirety, plus all 28 playoff games that would have to go to triple ot to be a contender for the number one spot.

Number 3: With 19 years with the sharks, toronto center Patrick Marleau has earned 32,043:25 minutes of ice time, earning the second most playoff minutes in this list. Considdering he spent 9 years with the sharks, it's impressive his 38 year old body has any cartilage left to pklay the game with.

At number 2: At 39, the bear turned shark probably has beard hair older than you. Joe Thorton has amassed  32,223:58 minutes, 1,427 points, and a +197 rating in his 20 year career. He is a rock steady player that can snipe with the best of them and grind with the worst of them. But even though he looks like father time, he may need a time machine to make up the 6,419 minute deficit that separates him from the number 1 slot.

And then there was big Z. With a clock shattering 38,642:36 minutes ice time, he is far ahead of the league in documented time on ice. To put it in perspective, if you were to watch every time he stepped on the ice back to back, you would be up for almost 27 days straight. His time on ice is long enough to watch the entire M\*A\*S\*H\* tv series, including the 2 hour finally, with commercials, 5 times over. He has logged 4,249:14 playoff minutes, also the most on this list. The 6'9 bear may very well be in his last season, but it will be a while before his impact on the leage will heal. In a hillarious twist of irony, he is the captain of rookie Jake debrusk, the son of louie Debrusk, who faught chara on the ice in the 90s. Must have been a little awkward in that locker room the first time they met.  Love him or hate him, there's no denying he is the most experienced guy on the ice.

This was a lot of fun to write and research, and I hope nobody get's their panties in a bunch over the numbers, it's all in fun.

55,Here’s why I’m a fan of the Golden Knights.,"I started watching hockey as a Flyers fan because I’m from the area. It’s hard not to be a fan of the home team around you when it’s constantly shoved down your throat. 

I remember when my friend first told me that Las Vegas would be having a hockey team. I thought it was kind of odd, but really neat at the same time. When I first heard the name I thought ‘huh... I would have guessed they’d go with something more desert-ish like the Scorpions...’

Throughout the year I kept hearing about the Las Vegas Golden Knights in my peripheral Flyers vision. Eventually the time came where these two teams would meet. Flyers visited Vegas for their first contest shortly after Philadelphia won the super bowl. I watched this game on TV and remember there being so many Flyers fans in the stands. When the Flyers scored it almost seemed like the cheers were louder for them than Vegas. At one point you could even hear the crowd chanting ‘E A G L E S EAGLES’

My fiancé and I watch hockey together and I told her I had enjoyed hearing about Vegas and thought it was really great how well they’re doing for a first year team. When the Flyers and Vegas met a second time, this time in Philadelphia, and the Flyers lost, she said to me ‘your team won’. And I laughed along with her over her humor.

The next chance I had to watch the Golden Knights was game two of round two against the Sharks, and it was this game when I really fell in love with this team. The energy from watching them on TV alone is incredible. Their pregame shows are really fun to see. The fans in the stands wearing all kinds of fun costumes add a lot of personality to it. Keep in mind that the Knights lost this game that I watched.

If all of this makes me a bandwagon fan, then I can only assume that anybody who thinks so is only salty that their team has never gotten this far or has had as good of a chance as the Knights do right now in their team’s entire history.

It’s great to see Fleury doing so incredibly well and having so much fun. It’s awesome to see the Knights defy all predictions round after round, game after game. It’s great for a first year team to give their fans and new fans elsewhere something to cheer for. 

I don’t know what’s going to happen next year, but I will still be a Knights fan if they make it as far or not next season. But in the meantime, I’m going to continue to enjoy watching them do what they’ve been doing all year long and hope that we get to see some neat history and watch them hoist the Stanley Cup in a few weeks.

Karlsson a 3rd line player with I think 9 goals last year and he’s ripped the league apart since joining Vegas.

147,Why wasn't the Capitals called for icing on the second goal - game 6?,"Man, I wish Kerry Fraser was still doing his column on TSN but I can't understand why the referee waved off icing on the second goal. 

To be fair, I think it was the correct and appropriate call based on so-called ""good hockey"" but I also believe it was 100% against the rules:

81.1 Icing - ... 
&gt; If the race for the puck is too close to determine by the time the
first player reaches the end zone face-off dots, **icing shall be called**. 

81.5 No Icing - ...
&gt; If, in the opinion of the Linesman, any player (other than the
goalkeeper) of the opposing team is able to play the puck before it
passes his goal line, but has not done so, play shall continue and the
icing violation shall not be called.

I am guessing 81.5 was the rule actually called but if you look the replay here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNOBq-3OR9s @ ~3:55 Braydon Coburn (TB) has no chance of catching the puck, the puck is clearly going to cross the line, neither player has made it to the dot, and Stephenson (WSH) is obviously hot on his ass; 

So this seems like 81.1 - icing and *not* 81.5. Therefor no goal.

BS aside, I hope Ovi wins.

Loss aversion is an important concept in behavioural economics that essentially states that humans feel something the pain of a loss twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. You can read more about loss aversion here.

The important distinction is that the Knights were able to make deals with other teams before the expansion draft that would allow teams to designate the player taken from them. This is where the concept of loss aversion plays a factor because the Golden Knights’ success can be largely attributed to the deals that were made during this time period",nhl,1527427693,deejayyou,0,3,True,2018-05-27

Overall, 67 Headlines on the first webpage’s Google News ""aggregated"" Sports Topics, and not one of them relating to anything about the NHL Stanley Cup Finals Hockey playoff happening currently in Las Vegas, Nevada, where more than 44&amp;#37; of the local Las Vegas viewers were watching the game last night!

This is unacceptable journalism and/or just BS Aggregation.

NHL United States American ice hockey is a much valued sport, and individuals involved with Google News Sports algorithms, as far as I’m concerned, should get their brains together and figure this ""journalism"" out. It’s a no brainer! Report on NHL Hockey directly after reporting on NBA basketball. WTF!

Ice Hockey is important in North America. Figure it out. It may not be important to you, or your organization, but why don’t y’all try watching a couple games live at a stadium. You could probably get comped tickets, and I know you’d love it.

Please consider an algorithm that may let an American individual interested in sports news in America, the day after a major sports playoff get some inkling of some idea of what may be happening in that part of the sports news!",nhl,1527645900,consideration,6,2,True,2018-05-29

393,This season feels tainted,"Joke or prod all you want ( I'm a bruins fan) however while being a bruins fan I live very close to Pittsburgh. I apologise if this gets long but it may be a good read for avid hockey fans. 

I got into hockey around 08 regrettfully late however my dad want into sports at all. It became my life from fall to spring my buddy was into it a little before me and pens fan of course. I grew to love this sport with a ton of passion. Went from watching every pens vs bruins game I could get. After getting my own apartment I got center ice and was able to watch everything it changed my world. I'll never forget our 2011 run or the 2013 run "" congrats to the Hawks "", we we're supposed to be a bubble team this year but over acheived and had as good of chance as any for the cup.

 I wanna state that Tampa Bay is a deeper, better team right now before I go any further and that the better team did win that series. How they won is what I wanna talk about. Hockey is a game of chances, missed, lucky you name it. The officiating in this post season has me worried as a fan. Not just for my team but the entire league. I hate the pens , I hear them gawking every single day at work however they were ripped off. Columbus had bad calls, Kings you name it. The entire Tampa vs Boston series tho was miss after miss after miss. The intermissions should have focused more on JT Miller, rolling 4 lines, Vassy standing on his head however the officiating being so poor led to replays and recaps every single game about how bruins are being robbed. This is not good for the sport and I want to know others opinions even possible biased TB opinions on how you honestly think this post season has been?

TLDR: How do you feel this post season has been ? Officiating fair? Worse than usual? 

I love the bruins but I love hockey in general. I watch games every night no matter who playing and I wanna see the league change for better.",nhl,1527725074,Daventry23,2,0,True,2018-05-30

Both of these conclusions come from the following quote from Bill Foley:

“People that live here call themselves Vegas,” Foley said. “‘Where you from? Vegas.’ They don’t say ‘Las Vegas.’ We’re the Las Vegas Golden Knights, that’s four words. We’re the Vegas Golden Knights. That’s three words. That’s the limit.”

28,Why the devils will beat Tampa!,"As an Islander fan and a division rival of the devils I have been cheering for the them in the 2018 stanley cup playoffs. I watched all the games so far, tampa has had so many penalties it's horrible. In the regular season Tampa was 27th in penalty killing which for cup contending team that takes penalties often is Horrible. For the devils their power play is pretty good and are 10th at the end of the season. With tampa’s urge to take penalties the devils will score more power play goals even tho they only have 2 goals they can still tire out tampa with drawing penalties and then start scoring. Tho Tampa has too superstars Stamkos and Kucherov and young underrated players they are definitely a favorite for the stanley cup but with the devils that have mixed with young and veteran players the younger players can learn from the veterans and have good chemistry. For example Taylor hall and Nico hischier on the same line Taylor can teach the young rookie tips about being in the nhl and they could have a good relationship, Just like Stamkos and kucherov but without the rookie part. The devils will obviously win in 7 games. The reason they will win is from tyring tampa out. In game one the devils were losing but tired tampa out so much that tampa looked like walruses on ice. As long as the devils have strong goaltending during the remaining games they can take them out. This is why I think they will beat tampa in the first round. This is a prediction!

164,I want to start watching and liking hockey,"I’m from the South(TX), never played hockey or even skated. Played football and basketball growing up and am an avid NBA (Mavs) fan. I’m moving to Montana in a few months and also hockey just seems dope, so therefore I wanna become a fan. So:

What team should I be a fan of?????? Help me decide. Here’s what I’m looking for-

A) not whoever the most popular team is out there. I hate trendy teams, or teams that just always win. I don’t wanna be a fan of the Patriots of the NHL if you know what I mean. I’m an underdog guy.

B) I know nothing about hockey, but in basketball I like teams that move the ball well and play classy ball (read: spacing and high IQ teams). Whatever the hockey version of teams that play like the Spurs, Warriors, Mavs, etc. good old school not hero-ball hockey. 

C) a good aesthetic. Yeah it’s stupid but ideally a team would have a good color scheme/ cool mascot. At first glance the Wild, predators, Black hawks, and coyotes have great aesthetics. 

D) ideally not a completely garbage team. I’m aware that tanking is a thing in hockey as well as the NBA, and as a Mavs fan I’ve had enough of the tanking. A decent/upcoming team would be ideal. 

Make the case for me to be the next big fan of your favorite team in the comments!!!! Pls I need guidance. ",nhl,1524285356,MT3maverick,12,4,True,2018-04-21

""Penguins lead 3-1""

Then, after the April 20th game it says: 

""Penguins lead 3-1""

What, the last game didn't count or something!? 

(They obviously took the time to update the website with the final score, but... why not update the series standings at the same time?)

180,"Does time get added back to the clock if a goal is overturned for offsides? Also, are there any limitations on challenging an overtime goal?","Sorry if this is dumb question, but I just thought of it and couldn't remember what happens.  Take this scenario for example:

A team is down 1 with 30 seconds left in the game.  They have possession of the puck, have pulled their goalie, and enter the offensive zone.  Although it wasn't called, a player was offiside on entry.  They maintain puck possession and the zone for 29 seconds and score at the last second.  The goal is challenged and it's determined they were offsides. The goal does not count and the game restarts with a faceoff in the neutral zone.  Clearly the clock management is important here.  The offsides not being called when it should have put the team in a position (unknown to them) where nothing they do matters until they either exit and reenter the zone or score and have it not count.


2nd question:  Can coaches challenge overtime game winners just like any other goal, or does the challenge have to come from somewhere else (much like booth review in the last 2 minutes of football).  The normal consequences for failed challenges (2 min DOG or loss of time out) obviously have no bearing in this situation.

I just finished pushing to github where anyone can grab it or make changes if they wish.

Let me know if there is anything else you guys want added.

*edit

I should mention, that if as long as you can run this program it's super easy to add a goal light or a power play light. You can use any of the off the shelf lights, like Hue or LIFX. I'm currently using it with a cheap light strip like this one on amazon.

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01JZ2SI6Q/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1

218,Thoughts on the flyers and Hextall’s legacy,"Can't wait to tell my kids about how this monster ruined the organization. 

We were a few years removed from a cup run and the organization began to stall. So we hired a hotshot GM and flyer legend to lead us back to dominance. The first year was tough, but with the hiring of a new up and coming coach, there was plenty of optimism. However, it quickly became obvious that the new coach was a dud who couldn't handle the locker room or the intricacies of the pro game. 2 pathetic 1st round playoff losses later and the city is calling for his head. However, our legend GM wouldn't fire him, said he still deserves time to build his culture. Thus begun the darkest time of the flyers history. Countless ahl players lined the roster sprinkled with promising, yet unused talent as the flyers dwelled in the basement of the metro for 5 years without a playoff appearance. All while our GM claimed it was all part of the rebuild and that Hakstol would eventually build a winning culture with the young guys. Eventually, after the fans finally realized that it wasn't Hakstols fault, but the GM's, the media began to turn on him. At a press conference following a pathetic 78 point season, one reporter finally asked what was on everyone's mind: ""what do you think this team needs in order to seriously compete? Because it's obvious that Hakstol and his game don't translate to the nhl and the fans are getting restless"". The GM took a moment to pause and think, and responded, ""we need about tree-fiddy"". 
It was about then that the media and fans began to put together the pieces and notice that this former flyer legend and GM was about 7 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Mesozoic era.

I made a petition to give Bruce Patrick McNall a presidential pardon. I know this is a long shot, but if enough people sign it, maybe it will come true? To make a long story short, Bruce McNall was the former owner of the LA Kings and the guy to brought Wayne Gretzky to Los Angeles. He owned various sports teams, race horses, was a coin collector and did many various businesses. In the 1990s, he pleaded guilty to 5 counts of conspiracy and fraud after he was unable to pay back a loan. He served 5 years in prison and was let out early for good behavior, however, is still labeled as a ""felon"". With a presidential pardon, this ""felon"" title will be removed. Please sign my petition if you think Bruce McNall should get a presidential pardon. Thanks!

The 2nd round is definitly this club's kryptonite for some reason. Doesn't matter even if they win the presidents trophy, dead in round 2.

Holtby had a rough season, and Grubauer seemed to rise to the occasion, only to under perform when given the playoff start. Now with Holtby starting again you have to wonder if there are some confidence/trust issue with the goaltending right now.

Even when winning the presidents trophy with a vezina goaltender round 2 killed them.

📷

**Jonathan Quick**

The Kings’ goalie allowed only 29 goals in 20 postseason games. As a result, L.A. became the first eight seed to capture the Stanley Cup. He has a 1.41 GAA and .946 SV&amp;#37; setting NHL marks for goalies who played at least 15 playoff games.

📷

**Martin Brodeur**

He is the all time leader in wins and shutouts. Matin has won three stanley cups but his greatest might be his 2003 season. In 24 games, Brodeur has a 1.65 GAA and 7 shutouts, a NHL record.

📷

**Dominik Hasek**

25,Random Fact: Wild and Predators dominate Sabres in Buffalo,"The Predators just beat the Sabres in Buffalo, AGAIN. So I did a little more research and I came across these mind-boggling stats.

Don't talk about home ice advantage to the Wild or Predators when they're in Buffalo. The Wild own an 81.8% points winning percentage over the Sabres in Buffalo (2-9-0 overall). It's even worse with the Preds: including the aforementioned game, they own an 87.5% winning points percentage over the Sabres in Buffalo (1-10-1 overall, seriously you only have 1 home victory in your lifetime over the Predators of all teams???).

There are 2 head-to-head records where the home team holds less than a 20% winning points percentage. In case you haven't figured it out yet, the Sabres dubiously hold both of those head-to-head records.

On that note, the Sabres must see Ryan Suter in their nightmares too: that overpaid sucker has a 7-1 record in Buffalo. He has only played for the Predators and Wild in his career, so I guess that makes sense.",nhl,1521509868,displacedindavis,0,2,True,2018-03-19
26,Random Fact: Bruins buried by Avalanche on home ice,"So while doing research for my previous post about the Sabres misfortunes against the Wild and the Predators at home, I came across this mind boggling stat.

The Avalanche have not been too great as of recent. That doesn't mean they don't get to feast upon some teams sometimes. Or, in the case of Boston, for years upon years upon years.

The last time the Bruins beat the Avalanche on home ice was March 30, 1998. That is not a typo. The Bruins have a streak surrendering points on home ice against the Avs that began before the turn of the millennium! That's the kind of stuff you see in college sports, not professional hockey.

To be fair, there was a tie in 1999. But a tie ain't a win.

To add more salt to the wound: most of those losses were close ones. By close, I mean the only loss by more than 2 goals was actually this years matchup, when the Avalanche destroyed the Bruins 4-0 in Boston. Most of those games follow familiar storylines: the Bruins fell into a big hole in the beginning and couldn't complete the comeback, the Bruins lost a close battle between the pipes, the Bruins squandered a 2 goal lead, the Bruins lost on a buzzer beater by Daniel Briere (that last one is unique, but no less soul-crushing).

On that note, this is one of only two such head-to-head streaks I found dating before 2000, and the only one that involves a road team beating the home team (as I said, this is the stuff of college sports, not professional hockey). The other one, Philadelphia's 14 game regular season home winning streak against Chicago since 1998, has a huge asterisk next to it since the Blackhawks crushed Philadelphia's soul by winning Game 6 of the 2010 Stanley Cup on Flyer ice. That technically doesn't count against the regular season head-to-head record because it was a playoff victory, but it does show that given the right circumstances, teams can exorcise their head-to-head record demons.

Perhaps the Bruins and Avalanche should meet in the SC Finals one year. Maybe the Bruins, if pushed hard enough, will finally win a home game against the Avs.",nhl,1521511420,displacedindavis,1,4,True,2018-03-19
39,Convince me Dave Hakstol is a good coach,"Self explanatory. Frustrated Flyers fan who is tired of the same song and dance in year 3. I’m a realist, I by no means think this is a Cup squad, but with one of the most talented prospect pools in the NHL and a pretty solid team in terms of youth and veterans this just isn’t good enough. 

My biggest gripes: doesn’t come off as “a leader of men”. He’s very emotionless. He gets outcoached more often than I think any Flyer fan would like to admit. His day-to-day management of the roster is absolutely piss poor, often favoring talentless veterans over the sake of more skilled younger guys who need the ice team to develop. He also can’t balance his goalies (see previous point: rode Brian Elliott in something along the lines of 16 straight games). 

One could argue “the young guys are doing well”  but my counter to that would be these were all highly regarded prospects with very high ceilings that *should* be doing well. I data to prove he’s “coaching them up”.

60,NHL.TV LIVE STREAMING BLACKOUT ANSWERS,"**What is a game blackout?**
A blackout is when a game will not be available for streaming live in the NHL streaming service. The users will have to wait until the replay is available on the service to watch that particular match and according to the NHL website that can take up to 48hrs after the match took place.

&amp;nbsp;

**What causes a blackout on the NHL Live streaming service?**
The reason way a match will be in blackout in the NHL streaming service is because the transmission rights were sold to a TV broadcaster, they call this matches ""in-market games"".
When the broadcaster buys games from the NHL it's included in the deal that the NHL does Not stream them in their service so people watch the broadcaster's transmission instead.
Unfortunately most local broadcasters buy most of the games of their local team so users that live where their favorite team is will not be able to watch most of the games using the NHL streaming service because of this. 
This effect can be as small as the county where the team is or as big as the whole state affecting multiple teams.
Most of the live games will be exclusively on TV in one of the local TV Stations for free or through a paying TV provider.

&amp;nbsp;

**When you say ""most of the games"" exactly how many do you mean?**
It varies per team but for example in the 2017-2018 season 77 out of the 82 RedWings regular season matches were sold to TV broadcaster.

&amp;nbsp;

**I'm in a different state than my favorite team, am I on the clear?**
No. There are also ""National Broadcasters"" that buy games off the NHL extending the stream blackout to the entire country. This are way less than the local blackout games and it varies greatly per team based on their popularity but to get a notion of how many national blackouts might take place in a season in the 2017-2018 season the team with the most national blackouts is Chicago with 19 out of the 82 regular season games.

&amp;nbsp;

**How can I tell if my local team is subject to blackouts?**
The NHL provides the blackout detector tool where based on your zip code it will tell which teams in the region have in-market games that season. 
https://www.nhl.com/info/nhltv-blackout-detector

&amp;nbsp;

**Does this affect the playoffs and the Stanly Cup Championship games?**
Yes it does.

&amp;nbsp;

**I'm not in the U.S nor Canada, am I in the clear?**
Yes. If the NHL streaming service is available in your country and with some exceptions like the UK were a TV Broadcaster there buys a dozen or so of games from the NHL per season.

&amp;nbsp;

**Is there a way to know in advance what games will be under the blackout status?**
Yes. The NHL website provides a Broadcasting schedule of the entire season moving forward here

&amp;nbsp;
https://www.nhl.com/schedule
&amp;nbsp;

If they have a broadcaster under ""Network"" that means most likely the match will not be available to stream live at a local and/or national level depending on the broadcaster who bought it:
National Blackout = The ones with a logo of the broadcaster i.e MSNBC, NHL Network.
Local Blackout = The ones with the letters of the broadcaster in plane text.

&amp;nbsp;

**Does the NHL disclaims this?**
Currently their advertise phrases the streaming service as ""Watch out-of-market games LIVE, and full archives on-demand."" and have a blackout information section on the bottom of the NHL.TV subscription page. 

&amp;nbsp;

**So what should I expect from the NHL Live streaming service?**
If you live in the same region than your favorite team there is a big chance you won't be able to watch most of their games live using the streaming service. You're going to have to rely on the local TV broadcast either for free or through a paying TV provider depending on who bought the game.
If you live far away from your favorite team then you will be able to watch most of the games live using the streaming service with an occasional national blackout or the local blackout of the team they are playing if it affects your area.
If you live outside the U.S/Canada and the streaming service is available in your Country you'll be able to watch every game live.
Regardless of where you live however you'll be able to access the game replays once there available and the rest of the off-line content.

&amp;nbsp;

**Do the other sport leagues do this?**
Yes. Currently some examples are:
&amp;nbsp;

-NBA: The NBA does not sell matches to the local market so only national blackouts affect their stream so you will be able to watch about 90% of the season. $11.99/month or $42.99/year
&amp;nbsp;

-NFL: The NFL sells every game to the market so currently none of the regular season is available to stream live in their service. However the subscription will give you live access to the post season including the Super Bowl. $24.99/month.
&amp;nbsp;

-MLB: Same as the NHL service. The whole season is subject to local and national blackouts including the postseason. $24.99/month or $115.99/year.
&amp;nbsp;

NOTE: This information can change at any day. The information is what was available at the moment of the post publication.

&amp;nbsp;

**Is there a way I can work around the blackouts?**
Yes. Now days there are various services online called ""VPN"" or ""DNS"" services that for a monthly fee they will rent out a server that is located in an area of the world that is not being affected by the blackouts. 
The way it works in simple terms is that they instruct you on how to change certain settings on your device so that it can connect to their server which connects to the streaming game for you and sends the signal back to your device.
Some streaming services not only the sports ones are working on detecting this so it is unknown how long this type of solution will last.

112,Random Fact: Carey Price drowned by oil,"The Edmonton Oilers may have been the laughingstock of the league for quite sometime, but Carey Price may want to think twice before chipping his Edmonton joke in.

It's been covered by several news outlets already, but Price's  failures against the Oilers are truly unfathomable. He owns a 2-7-1 record, a .859 SV%, and a 3.73 GAA against Edmonton. Coaches have even decided to sit Price in previous Montreal-Edmonton games.

Price is an incredible goalie when healthy, and normally I would say such unusual statistical horrors are best left unexplained. However, Price has actually played decently against the Oilers in March, with both of his wins against the Oilers coming in that month. If I had to take a shot at it, I think it might be an issue with complacency. After all, it's not like the Oilers are going to stop being the Oilers, or the Canadiens are going to stop being the Canadiens, due to one loss in October or even February (well, hopefully Geoff Molson and Marc Bergevin haven't completely wrecked the Canadiens at this point haha). But come March, when playoff standings begin being written in stone, that's when every game matters. Even one against the lowly Oilers.

Take last season, when Price put on his best performance against the Oilers in a 4-1 victory at Edmonton. This was a March game with heavy implications, and keep in mind this was against the best Oilers team we have seen in a very long time.

This, or the fact the Canadiens and Oilers don't see each other very much. Carey Price has statistically performed worse against teams from the Western Conference and perhaps the Oilers just happen to be the worst of the bunch. It's understandable that you would perform worse against teams you have less experience against, but 2-7-1 against the Oilers is still pretty bad.

Interestingly, there were trade rumors that Price was gonna be traded to Edmonton earlier this season. While speculative, that certainly is one way to purge someone's statistical demons.

Injuries have held him back as of recent, but here's to hoping that Price returns to form and lives up to his massive contract extension that kicks in next year. I'm confident he can and that 1 or 2 bad games against the Oilers each year won't have much effect on his legacy as a great goaltender.",nhl,1521845938,displacedindavis,1,1,True,2018-03-23

144,Nhl 18 my first Nhl game since Nhl 12 on ps3,"So I've only played 2 Nhl games, Nhl 98 and Nhl 12. When I get a good hockey game I just stick to it. I really liked the gameplay of 12 and it felt comfortable controlling the skaters etc. and feels fun to just play. Nhl 18 on Ps4 just doesn't feel good at all playing, just feels like a robot skating for some reason. And too detailed with the skating drift when you try to change directions and pivot action, just not fun at all. I guess they wanted close to reality but it's too sensitive. And on Nhl 12 I could customize my camera to get closer to the ice but on Nhl 18 the closest is Action Cam, and it just doesn't seem close enough for me, especially if I ""prefer up"" camera mode. I can barely see the players in detail, and when it's closer the gameplay feeling is better.  Is there a previous version on Ps4 that would feel closer to Nhl 12, or are all the "" newer games"" this same style? Would Nhl 15, 16 or 17 play any different?

228,2018 Rookies that will have the most impactful careers?,"Not necessarily the top 10 from this year, but more of a projection of their careers. Here's my list, in no particular order:

- Brock Boeser - Natural goal scorer. In every one of the three games I've seen him in, he's scored. Should probably get used to that.

- Mathew Barzal - It's gonna be fun watching him over the next decade plus. Possession skills are up there with the best of them.

- Clayton Keller - Ditto with what I said about Barzal. I remember an OT game against the flyers earlier in the year where he had the puck on his stick for what felt like 4 of the 5 minutes of the OT period. 
 
- Charlie McAvoy - If I could have any young defenseman in the league it'd be this guy (minus the Columbus pair). Everything he does looks so... natural. Reminds me a little of Erik Karlsson.

- Nico Hischier - I didn't know anything about him to start the year admittedly, other than this is the guy taken over Patrick. Well, I can see why. 

- Nolan Patrick - Has had his rough patches this year but no question the talent is there. Add in the physical presence he brings and grittiness on the poke check. He's the type of guy that will have a timid rookie year by all accounts then all of a sudden bring the hammer and a 30-goal season in year two. 

- Pierre Luc Dubois - Already a refined two way player. Maybe not as high of a ceiling in terms of scoring as some others on this list, but a great prospect with a long career ahead of him. 

- Alex DeBrincat - Only watched one Blackhawks game this year but he just so happened to score a hat trick. So yeah. 

- Tyson Jost - Two things I notice watching the Avs this year: 1. Holy shit has McKinnon always been this dominant? 2. Jost has some serious agility, skating ability, and stick skills. Looks to be a playmaker for years to come. 

- Mikhail Sergachev - This last spot was the toughest. Don't get me wrong Sergachev looks great. But everytime I've watched TB it feels like he doesn't play that much, or maybe as much as he should. Also I've noticed he's usually never out there against the top lines, which I guess if you had TB's defensive depth why would you? Certainly a top tier talent, and will probably be a first pair defenseman in the not-too-distant future.

Honorable Mentions: Travis Sanheim, Danton Heinen, Alex Kerfoot, Yanni Gourde, Jesper Bratt, Will Butcher 

Note: Some players played last year and I decided were ineligible for the list, such as Kyle Conner and Joel Eriksson-Ek

424,A Crazy Scenario That Can Happen Tonight Between the Blues and Avs,"So, with the Avalanche vs Blues game tonight, we basically have a wild card game in the NHL. It would seem simple enough that whoever wins the game gets the 2nd wildcard spot, but it’s the NHL, so it has to be made 10 times more confusing. 

After a series of tiebreakers, basically the result is that the Blues can clinch a spot with a single point, due to the season series tiebreaker they hold over the Avs. Which means the avalanche would need to get a regulation win, which would give them more points and put them in a playoff spot. If the game does go into OT, and the Avs win, it wouldn’t matter, they would both have 95 points, both have 41 ROW, but the blues would get the advantage because they would have a 2-1-1 record opposed to the Avs 2-2-0 record against each other.

Which leads me to an interesting scenario I thought of. Imagine if the game is tied late in the 3rd, the Avs need a regulation win to make the playoffs.

Does that mean the Avs would need to pull their goalie in a tie game to try to make a playoff spot?
I’m not sure if this has ever happened before in the NHL, where a goalie was pulled in a tie game due to crazy scenarios, but there is definitely a chance that it can happen tonight.
If it has happened in a NHL game before, please tell me, but we can really see something crazy go down tonight.

Tampa Bay Lightning- All I can say is wow. Last season Tampa bay did as bad as Montreal did this season and we came in third place in the entire NHL. Winnipeg beat us with point and we ended the season with a presidents trophy deciding game. If Tampa won we would’ve had first in the league and the presidents trophy would’ve been ours. That was our game but we got obliterated 4-1. That gave the Bruins a chance to take our title of top of the Atlantic with their last game of the season. If they won, they would take Tampa’s title. They went against my second favorite team the panthers and here’s what happened ——————————————————————————————————————————
Florida Panthers- The panthers did fairly well this season ending the season with a 5 game win streak. That win over the bruins 4-2 put them ahead of the playoff clinching avalanche but sadly not in the top three of the division. Now the panthers did have a very small chance to get the wild card before their five game win streak. They would’ve had to have 6 consecutive wins or 5 consecutive wins with one OT loss. Sadly, we got the five wins but one loss putting us one point behind the devils and the blue jackets who successfully clinched the wild card. Luckily Tampa gets to go against New Jersey first round and hopefully blow em out of the water. 
——————————————————————————————————————————
Vegas Golden Knights- The Golden knights first season, finishing 5th in the league and second I believe in the pacific division. Incredible. Tampa and Vegas  constantly traded first in the league due to both of our continual victories pushing us far past the competition. However, later in the season they started to slack, bringing them down 4 places. This kept Tampa at first for a while until Nashville started their unbeatable win streaks.
——————————————————————————————————————————
Nashville Predators- Where did these guys come from? Sitting at 5th-10th the whole season till the end. That carried them to the presidents trophy. They just woke up at the end and obliterated their competition. On their last game against Tampa, they were neck and neck, tampa with 113 points and Nashville with 115 points, that game decided who took home that presidents trophy and the predators succeeded with a 4-1 victory. Well played Nashville.
——————————————————————————————————————————
Buffalo Sabres- Ha, first ever team to come 31st place in the league. Last place out of 31. The top teams had more then double your points. Get a grip guys.
——————————————————————————————————————————
Montréal Canadians- Lol Jack (My friend) suck it,Montreal did absolutely terrible this season and got beat by the Lightning. All I need to say LMFAOO.",nhl,1523242898,DemonicGummy,0,0,True,2018-04-08

- 1-2 record in the Finals
- 5 first round exits in 13 years along with 2 years of missing the playoffs
- first round exit as the best team In the NHL (58 wins) 


If the Leafs get bounced in the first round again will he be looked at as overrated? He’s the highest paid coach in the NHL and many people claim he’s the best, and always bring up team Canada, even though that’s not really relevant to being a good NHL coach.

494,Has Laine been NHL-worthy since his first game?,"You could say I'm pretty new to the league as I only started really following the sport on this level after my old schoolmate Puljujärvi and the ""new Finnish flash"" Laine (and of course Matthews) started getting seemingly all the headlines. 

So my question is, have players like Laine and Matthews just been so good all the time to not have been sent down to the AHL? Or is it just that their teams needed what they can offer so bad all the time? Also, some players struggle hard before they eventually break into the NHL roster and that's normal, but at what point can you really call a, say, top 15 pick a bust?",nhl,1523352940,meinli,3,1,True,2018-04-10

4,Am I crazy to think Hall should be in the running for the MVP?,"Hear me out, Taylor Hall should at least be in the talks for it and I barely hear anything about him.  Is it because he’s on the Devils?  Hall is having a tremendous season and the Devils would not be anywhere near where they are now without him.  

He drives the Devils offense pretty well by himself, much like MacKinnon on the Avs.  He is also on something crazy like a 16 game point streak with like 24 points.  I personally don’t think it’s that crazy for him to be a runner up or even a winner if he can keep up this point streak for a little longer and maybe even have the devils make the playoffs.

Open to people’s thoughts on this opinion of mine. LMK",nhl,1518755507,FlashScampers,7,5,True,2018-02-15

Information does change throughout the day, and we update info throughout the day until we change the flair to the FINAL Edition.  Most predictions are pulled from Left Wing Lock, but occasionally I will change them if I have differing information, especially regarding a goalies' first start coming back from an injury. Historic trends show the first posted predictions right 83% of the time when we term it ""Projected"", 97% right on ""Likely"", and 100% correct on both ""Very Likely"" and ""Confirmed"".

64,Sweater Sizing Help,"HELP!
I found a vintage sweater of my favorite player but have no idea if it will fit me. It's a Nike Men's Large probably made around 2002. Currently I have an Adidas size 50 and it fits me perfectly with or without a hoodie under it. 

There is the same sweater in XL and just not sure which to buy. Since it's from Ebay I want to make sure I get it right the first time. 

My question is how does a Nike L or XL compare to an Adidas 50. I've looked online at sizing charts but none have both types to compare against. 

Any help on size comparison would be greatly appreciated!

140,What does everyone want to see for first round playoff matchups?,"As of right now the matchups in the East would be:
TBL vs. CBJ, WSH vs. NJD, BOS vs. TOR, and PIT vs. PHI
The West would be:
VGK vs. MIN, NSH vs. STL, SJS vs. LAK, and WPG vs. DAL

Obviously there's still a lot of hockey to be played, but I like these matchups a lot, especially in the East.  Boston vs. Toronto and Pittsburgh vs. Philadelphia are great rivalries.  Tampa vs. Columbus would probably be the least entertaining but not terrible.  Washington vs. New Jersey would be really interesting and could be surprisingly good.

The matchups out west don't excite me as much, but Nashville vs. St. Louis would probably be really good, as would Winnipeg vs. Dallas.  San Jose vs. Los Angeles is a good rivalry matchup even though San Jose is one of the least physical teams this year.  Vegas vs. Minnesota could be really interesting, especially seeing what Vegas can do come playoff time.

It's still early, but I would not complain if these were the first round matchups.  Playoff hockey is always good, but the more rivalry matchups the better.  I like the way the league sits right now, even though some teams will probably change come April.  What do you guys think?  Who do you want to see play in the first round?

373,Playoff proposal (never will happen),"So, playoff schedule right now is this 

- top 3 teams in each division qualify (6 teams)
- top 2 teams that didn't qualify with part A in the conference qualify for the playoffs.  (2 teams) 

And they get bracketed based on standings. 

Of course this is frustrating for teams like the Avs this year who would be firmly in WC2 if they were in the East. 

Last year the East was much stronger, making it so that some of the top teams in the league were kicked out by even stronger teams in the first round. (bluejackets, canadians) 
___________________________________________________
My proposal (which gets rid of both of those problems) 


Playoff wild cards play a best of 3 games series, which just take the best 8 teams that weren't in the top 3 per division, and rank them 1-8. 

The winner of those games plays the number 1 or 2 seed for each conference. The Highest seed gets to choose their first opponent based on their rankings. 

IE: predators, knights, lightning and capitals win their divisions. 

If the lighting are #1 in points, they get to choose their opponent out of the 4 wild card winners. 

They then play down the brackets.

A goal will be scored: Then it seems like things stop if something is questionable and officials meander around the bench waiting for it.  Is this the case?

Why are they allowed to do this if that is the case?  Shouldn't it be the responsibility of the coaches to get a linesmen attention or instigating a challenge?  Shouldn't they go back to position after a goal is scored?  

In football,  many times a team will hurry to the line to prevent a challenge from being called, I get that Hockey is different but I have notice players chilling by the bench,  shouldn't they be in position on center ice waiting for the puck to drop? (scoring team should be at the face off circle)

I am not sure,  I know some of the things I said are based on the officials asking about a challenge but it certainly seems like they aren't trying to continue the game.  They need to act like nothing is different, make their way to the position,  Players congrats each other so there is plenty of time to get an officials attention.

470,"A little help understanding, please?","First off, I'm sorry I'll ask these stupid questions that for almost all of you might be ridiculously obvious. I'm new at this, ice hockey is not at all popular in my country. But I'm getting interested and I'd like to understand how some things work. I know the rules, I understand them so that's not a problem. Sometimes I forget what a certain term means but when I look it up, I remember. 

So, first question. I know the season in October and ends on April. So there's no NHL in between? I know that like 16 teams qualify for the Stanley Cup, what about the others? They don't play at all?

Another question I don't quite get. I've always liked the Vancouver Canucks, and now that I'm getting more into hockey I've started following them. Anyway, I've noticed that most fans are saying that they should ""tank"" or are already doing it. I know it has something to do with they losing so much, and that somehow relates to picking new players for next season. How does that work? Not tanking only, like the whole trading-players-thing. 

I don't know if I'm clear enough with these questions, please bear with me. I'm new and I really wanna understand the game and everything that comes with it. Thank you so much!",nhl,1520995435,MrWhatIf,8,3,True,2018-03-13

478,Random Fact of the Day: Canadiens struggle against young franchises,"The Montreal Canadiens may be the best franchise overall, but they have had their struggles against franchises under 30 years old. As of today, here are the stats:



Record against teams formed before 1990: 3517-2406-818

Record against teams formed after 1990: 272-257-27



Not that this changes the stats, but the only reason Montreal has a winning record in the latter category is their 38-20-2 record against Winnipeg. Most everyone has dominated that team historically (especially when they were still in Atlanta), so that's not saying much, but let's give credit where it's due.

The records include playoff series as well. Teams that relocated in the 1990s are not included (Stars, Hurricanes, Coyotes, Avalanche) because they were not formed after 1990.

Records against the individual teams (not including the aforementioned Jets):



San Jose Sharks: 15-19-4

Ottawa Senators: 74-70-5

Tampa Bay Lightning: 53-52-6

Anaheim Ducks: 15-15-2

Florida Panthers: 44-44-6

Nashville Predators: 12-11-1

Columbus Blue Jackets: 12-13-1

Minnesota Wild: 8-12-1

Vegas Golden Knights: 1-1-0



You can verify these on sports stats site MCUBED. There's definitely no scientific explanation behind this, and it doesn't detract from the Canadiens historical success. However, it's still pretty pathetic that the Canadiens don't have a winning record against the Blue Jackets and Panthers. For a team that's supposed to be the historical gold standard of hockey, this is a weird, if not somewhat embarrassing, trend (I mean, acknowledging you have trouble beating the Panthers has gotta be a little demoralizing). Maybe Seattle's impending new team will reverse this, who knows?

In case you are wondering, yes I do hate the Canadiens and am glad to see them failing this year.

485,Random fact: the Blues sing the Blues in the playoffs,"Thought the Capitals were funny for not getting past the second round? They are. But Blues fans have it rougher. They've been knocked out before the conference finals 33 out of 48 times in their history. Not that they've done much afterwards. Since their 3 fluky Stanley Cup finals appearances from 1968-70, they've lost all 4 finals appearances they've appeared in. I say fluky because the Blues were in the trashiest of trash divisions back in the day and had a really fortunate expansion draft rivaling that of Vegas. 

Oh yeah, let's also add 8 times they missed the playoffs. I mean, you could make the argument that the Blues are consistently good. Unfortunately, that's not gonna win you any Stanley Cup games, let alone Stanley Cups.

I do sincerely hope the Blues win a SC one day. Some teams just bloom very late like that I guess. However, I don't think it will be happening anytime soon.",nhl,1521064131,displacedindavis,4,10,True,2018-03-14

Examples:
COL@TOR
http://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/game/2017020726/feed/live
Events 162 and 163 are related to the challenge. There's no goal event prior, and no timeout used (from which I can infer that the challenge was successful).

CBJ@VGK
http://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/game/2017020741/feed/live
Events 50 and 51 are related to the challenge. Event 49 is a goal event, and even 52 is a timeout, from which I can infer that the challenge was unsuccessful.

So yeah, I can use the data to figure out if the challenge is successful or not, but it's kind of cumbersome and I'm hoping I'm missing something that shows the result of the challenge much more obviously.

Having fun, having a laugh and gaining social media attention, not seeing who can grab a puck, put it on a sick, and toss it into a hoop... The league has to go back and look at 2016. That was probably the most fun competition of all time and it gained the most viewers as well. 

Back in 2016 I would've said the NHL All Star Skills competition was by far the best of all leagues, but the NHL has taken such a step backwards, the NBA All Stars is easily better in all ways. 

Just my two cents tho. Love to hear what everyone else has to say!",nhl,1517109077,DarkenedAngel,3,0,True,2018-01-27

211,Addressing the Pacioretty trade rumours,"The Canadiens captain’s bad sequence (1 goal in 22 games) has led to ongoing trade rumours. Will the Habs trade their captain?

Max Pacioretty has become, over the years, one of the NHL’s most prolific snipers as he’s had 5 straight 30 goal seasons (excluding the lockout shortened season back in 2012-13) and he’s done it without an elite #1 center. David Desharnais, Tomas Plekanec and Phillip Danault have been his more frequent centres over the past years, yet all of them are unquestionably #3 centres. So when the Habs acquired Jonathan Drouin from the Tampa Bay Lightning and transformed him into a center, some would’ve expected Pacioretty to have his first career 40 goal season. Well, he’s not even on pace for half of that total, scoring 8 goals in 40 games for Montreal, putting him at a abysmal 16 goal pace.

So what’s wrong with the guy? For starters, one thing that can explain his scoring difficulties is the team he plays for, the Montreal Canadiens. They’re the third lowest scoring team in front of only Buffalo and Arizona, two teams that finish in the bottom tier year after year. To give you an idea of how much trouble they have putting the puck in the net, here’s an example. The Vegas Golden Knights, the very surprising expansion team, have 7 players with more points than Montreal’s leading scorer, Alex Galchenyuk who has 22 points in 40 games putting him on a pace for a 44 point year. That’s just plain embarrassing and therefore shows that the lack of offensive punch in Montreal is contributing to Pacioretty’s slump. The second reason is obvious: the loss of Alexander Radulov. To start the 2016-17 season, Pacioretty had only 5 goals in 29 games. Then during a game against the LA Kings on December 4th of 2016, he was placed on a line with Radulov. The rest is just history.

From that game on to the end of the regular season, Pacioretty lit the lamp 30 times in 53 games playing with the Russian for the rest of the season. If he kept that pace for one full season, it’s a 47 goal year. Since Radulov left for Dallas, the captain just isn’t his usual self. Another big reason Pacioretty is struggling is the hiring of Claude Julien and the firing of Michel Therrien. Julien’s teams have always played a very defensive style while Therrien’s teams have always played a fast style that would help create turnovers. Since Julien was hired, Pacioretty has 16 goals in 78 games which is 0.2 goals per game compared to the time with Therrien where he had 158 goals in 354 games which is about 0.45 goals per game (includes playoffs). He basically scores twice more when under Therrien than under Julien. Let’s also not forget that Pacioretty had a stunning 0 goals in 6 games in the playoffs last year, also under Julien. It’s clear to everyone that Pacioretty plays way better under Therrien than under Julien.

The final reason explaining Pacioretty’s failures makes a lot of sense. Maybe he just dislikes playing in Montreal. Just being a player for a team like that means you’ll be obliged to handle criticism and scrutiny from the media and all the fans. But being the captain of the hockey Mecca that the Montreal market is puts an extreme amount of pressure on the player and that leads to a bunch of distractions on and off the ice, especially when the team is losing, because when you think of what a true captain is like, he’s supposed to lead the team out of the slump. Well that’s just the opposite of what Pacioretty is doing. So with all this said, does it make sense for the Canadiens organization to part ways with their leader? Yes, it really does. Pacioretty just needs a fresh start with a team where there won’t be many distractions and where he’ll be able to focus on hockey. For the Canadiens, it makes perfect sense, especially with the situation they’re in. Geoff Molson doesn’t want to admit it. Marc Bergevin doesn’t want to admit it. Claude Julien doesn’t want to admit it. However, what’s clear is clear. The Montreal Canadiens, with their actual roster and situation won’t compete for even the playoffs anytime soon. The best path for them is to rebuild, and trading Pacioretty is the best start because if Marc Bergevin pulls the trigger on a deal like that, he’s sending that exact message. So Marc, if you’re looking at this article, strongly consider a rebuild and get rid of hefty contracts like Weber’s and Shaw’s and get rid of your veterans. Start building the Montreal Canadiens future foundation because you and your team won’t get anywhere if you’re still competing for a playoff spot.

Now that you think about it, what’s the point of making the playoffs when you know your roster isn’t built enough for a run at the Stanley Cup? It’s why the players play and it’s why you make trades: to win the most prestigious award in possibly all of sports. So the only trades you can make now to get that team somewhere are the ones where you receive good draft picks and solid prospects. And that all starts with Max Pacioretty.

https://www.coolhockey.com/us/new-york-rangers-adidas-authentic-home-nhl-hockey-jersey.html

This first link shows the adidas home jersey blank for $179, Pre-Stitched for +$40, Hand Stitched for +$70. 


https://www.coolhockey.com/us/new-york-rangers-any-name-adidas-authentic-home-nhl-hockey-jersey.html

This 2nd link appears to be the same jersey, but the pre-stiched is $179, and the hand-stitched is $219. 

So why would the hand-stitched be $249 in the first link but only $219 in the 2nd link?",nhl,1513632294,mcniff1012,1,0,True,2017-12-18

Suggestions?

I click it and guess what? It's darts. DARTS!!!! How is someone on the west coast, affecting anything at 11am when nothing else is on???

This is not an isolated event. The other day, Leafs vs Wild, again listed on Shaw SNO but they were broadcasting Bruins vs Capitals??? WTF!!!!

Both teams were operated by different organizations though they became the Maple Leafs. With this logic can't Detroit claim the Victoria Cougars win in 1924-25 seeing as the team and players were bought and relocated to Detroit in 1926, in fact operating as the Detroit Cougars until the 1930-31 season. With this rational can't any team claim a win from a previous team as long as they purchased said franchise.

________________________________________________

First, you'll need a way to outright block IP addresses. I used this successfully on my Windows 10 computer: https://www.serverintellect.com/support/windowsserversecurity/ipsec-blockip/

It's even better if you have a home router capable of blocking IP's for the entire household network. 

Simply block the following IP addresses:

65.202.184.40

65.202.184.33

If you block the entire 65.202.184.xxx domain you're likely to catch anything I missed as well.

432,Concussions in Male Athletes playing in the NHL,"My name is Mike and I am writing this post to gather some input on whether or not having concussions is becoming an issue within male athletes playing contact sports such as hockey. I wanted to ask around specifically in a league such as the NHL and see how people felt about it. I remembered when I suffered from a concussion years ago and I can tell you it was no joke. In addition, the issue I believe is becoming more serious by the day and is affecting many athletes health. Reason being is due to certain symptoms I have seen many people suffer from after having concussions such as fatigue, signs of depression, and even issues with certain cognitive functions.

So with that being said I wanted to get some feedback and insight from people since I am currently doing academic research on this topic and really think getting some thoughts on this topic would be greatly beneficial. I am definitely open to seeing other people's perspectives on this topic and seeing if there is another way to look at it.

In addition, I am doing also doing a survey that can potentially see if there is a real problem in certain areas of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania pertaining to concussions in sports and also seeing if it can possibly cause certain diseases. So please comment below with your views, which would be greatly appreciated!

Please see link if you would like to do the survey. If you have any questions please let me know!

446,More than meets the eye in this Vlasic interview...,"I found this Vlasic interview very intriguing because there is a couple of things that can be drawn out from it. 

Interview in question: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMOqWlpPYTc&amp;t=0s

The first question of the interview asks Vlasic, what does their five goal output from tonight due to the conception of the sharks that they have lost offence with the departure of Patrick Marceau. Vlasic responds jokingly with ""the sharks can score goals, huh, we can play exciting hockey."" From here we can deduct a couple of things. One, Vlasic was aware of this depiction of the Sharks. Now the more important question is whether or not he agrees with that statement. One could argue that he does, that Vlasic is recalling the days when the Sharks could score five goals with relative ease. Now one could argue in response he's making the joke because he knew eventually the goal draught would end based on their play because as he says, the sharks have had the chances in the past but just weren't able to hit the back of the net.  I think judging on the next two questions and answers that the former will be revealed to be more likely. 

In the second question, the interviewer asks about is Logan Couture reaching the halfway point of his goal for a thirty-goal season (tried to phrase that as well as I could... sorry.) and how getting Corture going plays into the Shark's strategy for success. Vlasic's response is interesting. Vlasic states that it's not Couture who needs to get going to replace some of the offence that the Sharks lost during the off-season. He says that Couture is a 30+ goal scorer playing against the top d-lines in the league. If we look at last season, thirty goals puts Couture around the top 26th-24th mark for goal scorer's in the league. His actual number for last year, 25, puts him at 49th. Regardless, Vlasic has just described Couture as one of the lower-mid elite tier players in the league. Vlasic goes on to say the rest of the Sharks need to get up to that level of their play, therefore labelling Couture as the Shark's best player. That's not a pretty picture that he describes for his team if Couture is there top player. 

Now the third question, when asked about what direction he feels the team is headed, Vlasic replies with the PR answer, ""I think we're playing well, couple points out of first place in the division, every nights a battle"" and that not every night is a guaranteed win. In doing so he clearly creates a divide between where the Sharks were two years ago and where they are now. 

Now let's revisit our first question with the analysis above in mind. Vlasic thinks that the Sharks aren't as good as they were and he's not fully confident about where the team is headed. That being said, they are winning right now, so we will see where the Sharks go from here.

I think he is drunk and depressed because he misses playing hockey. That's also why he was willing to do an Enterprise commercial in the first place.",nhl,1509595209,kevinnetter,1,1,True,2017-11-02

However, with there being no Indiana or Cincinnati NHL team, I need some advice on which team to root for since I want to have a sport other than basketball to watch in the winter. I don't really want to root for the Blackhawks since they are such a bandwagon hotspot, especially where I live, but I'm open to just about anything.

&amp;nbsp;


As of the November 10th games, here's what the standings would look like *based on point percentage* keeping in mind the point percentage is based on 3 potential points for each game. Also, feel free to correct my math if i've obviously botched something. Other than that, what are your thoughts? We're only ~15 games in but it's still fun to look and see.

I really hope you enjoy it, as I said before, it was my first really big interview, and the ratings have been through the roof since release!

Topics we covered include what makes a great writer, the homogenous nature of the majority of hockey coverage, developing a chemistry with your cohost, the inability in the culture for hockey players to be unique, the Olympics, that Edmonton Oilers happiness controversy, and so much more.

From the surface, its easy to think that im a bandwagon Blackhawk fan, but in a household where i only played basketball with my friends, the bulls were the team to follow. But then that changed. And im glad i watch the NHL. From moments like Domi one punching Kesler, the Red Wing-Lightning fight, nick bonino (snubbed from the US hockey world cup team) scoring the game winner to seal the victory against the caps, all 3 california hockey teams in the playoffs, the hawks getting stunned by the preds, the Jets shitting on the hawks in the regular season last year, duncan keith's game winner in double OT, the Sharks booting the kings 4-1 in the playoffs and making it to the cup. The preds being a wild card team making it to yhe cup. All of these moments i cherish and are the reason why hockey is the greatest sport on the planet.

Now that Pasta has a contract there's not a doubt in my mind that #88 is the Jersey for me.  

This year for my birthday she got us tickets to a game at TD Garden and said if I can find a decent deal on a Pastarnak jersey she would grab that too and she would take mine hand-me-down style because she was thinking of picking one up herself and doesnt want a named jersey anyway.  It seems like a lot of places have deals with Reebok jerseys going out so there are options, but a lot of the places seem sketchy so Im hoping for recommendations that you all trust.

484,Where would the Oilers have finished last year without Connor McDavid?,"This is an idea for a project if anyone is down to take the time to do it all out of curiosity. Where would the Oilers have finished without McDavid? would they still be a playoff team? I know this isn't an exact replica on what would've happened but i'm just curious and maybe soemone good with stats can help me. 

So for example. Let's say there was a game that was Edmonton vs the Sabres. Let's assume the score was 3-1 Edmonton. Let's say Connor McDavid had 3 points that game, so he was a part of ever goal. Now what if he wasn't there? let's say you take each point he got away, so then the score would've been 1-0. i know that wouldn't have been this exact circumstance but this is just all out of curiosity. so if for all 82 games you take out each goal that he was involved in, how many games would they have won? what would their record have been? would they have made the playoffs? i'm curios. 

I know i'll probably get downvotes because ""the team would've looked different"" and i know that. I know games would've been played different and i know maybe they would've / wouldn't have made the playoffs. This is all just me being curious.

99,There's no evidence to support the claim that Gretzky is definitively the GOAT,"One of the best? Sure. We can probably solidify that.

I'll begin at a crucial point: Lemieux had an almost identical Points Per Game rate as Gretzky (1.92 to 1.88) and played in lower scoring seasons. Who was the better forward between them? Hard to say. Equally Mario never got to reach those milestone heights due to intense diseases outside his control.

Not to mention things like secondary assists. I'm not certain but Mike Bossy *could* have had a fairly similar or maaaybe higher Primary Point Rate to Gretzky. He scored goals at a much higher rate. I mean there's so much we need to fully assess. Ice Time is naturally crucial, linemate quality also etc.

Hasek had the best goaltending impact by an extremely wide margin, his GSAA numbers and ability make you question if he's mortal or not. Orr similarly for D in terms of scoring and his talent was preposterous. They're both head and shoulders above their peers and D / G are either about as valuable as F or more.

Gretzky was amazingly fortunate. He came into the league at exactly the perfect time. He benefitted immensely from the era of kick save goaltending and haphazard D strategy, among other nuances. Sid is easily one of the best ever as well and could very well have a greater impact than Gretzky all told.

Not to mention that GF% ultimately is the ideal measurement of skater impact... but that's a whole other kettle of beans and gets us into really tricky territory like trying to unravel +/- numbers from the 70s.

At the end of the day the GOAT discussion is a sketchy one. It's very difficult given the 5 main candidates play 3 different positions and only two played in the same era. Which is fine, it makes for interesting discussion, it's fun to investigate. I hope this can help constructively get the ball rolling at very least.",nhl,1504115389,Radu47,8,0,True,2017-08-30

153,The 10 Worst Trades in NHL History1. Marian Hossa,"Why do we do this, anyways? Is it because everyone likes to play “backseat GM” and claim that we wouldn’t make these poor executive decisions? Is it because we are gluttons for punishment and like to torture ourselves by remembering the dark times? Regardless, it doesn’t matter how many trade deadlines the league goes through, there always comes that time when the hockey-viewing populous reminisces over the worst transactions made.

The NHL is about turn 100 years old, which means there is plenty of time for front offices to fudge a trade decision at least once. But no matter how many transactions occur, everyone still looks back on Adam Oates making Red Wings history. Or Eric Lindros being swapped for half a roster. Or, everyone’s favorite, The Great One jetting off to California.

What makes these trades so bad isn’t necessarily the trades themselves, but the aftermath of them. Here are the NHL’s top 10 all-time worst trades in no particular order.The trade: The Atlanta Thrashers traded Marian Hossa, along with winger Pascal Dupuis, to the Pittsburgh Penguins for Colby Armstrong, Angelo Esposito, Eric Christensen, and a first-round draft pick.

The aftermath: Here is a textbook “bad trade.” Before they moved up to Manitoba to be the Winnipeg Jets, the now-debunked Thrashers lost a lot, but had a chance to give itself a makeover. So they shipped star player Hossa to Pittsburgh. That plan didn’t work in their favor however, as Atlanta’s takeaway from the trade didn’t evolve into anything substantial.

Hossa’s future was significantly brighter. He was part of the Stanley Cup-contending Pens and Detroit Red Wings before winning two championships during his current lengthy tenure with the Chicago Blackhawks. Even though the scoring Slovak is pushing 40, he continues to churn out points (515 career goals, 597 career assists) and climb the NHL all-time goals list.

2. Roberto LuongoThe trade: The Florida Panthers traded Roberto Luongo, Lukas Krajicek, and a sixth-round pick to the Vancouver Canucks in exchange for Todd Bertuzzi, Alex Auld, and Bryan Allen. (2006)

The aftermath: Oh yes, Luongo’s first stint in net for Florida. That stretched ended with quite well for the netminder, who headed to Vancouver to become a pillar for the competitive Canucks team we know so well from the early 2000s.

In return for the goalie and company, the Panthers got a troubled Bertuzzi, who only lasted a handful of games before being shipped off to Detroit, (and then Anaheim, and then Calgary, and then back to Detroit.) Luongo has since returned to Florida and has been bit by the injury bug on a couple occasions. But back in 2006, he came out on the good end of a bad trade for the Panthers.

3. Jaromir JagrThe trade: The Pittsburgh Penguins traded Jaromir Jagr, along with defenseman Frantisek Kucera, to the Washington Capitals for Kris Beech, Michal Sivek, Ross Lupaschuk, future considerations, and cash (2001).

The aftermath: Once upon a hockey, a 29-year-old Czech superstar named Jagr decided that he wanted a trade from the Penguins’ team that he had won a couple Stanley Cups with. While both parties are doing just fine now, there was no happy ending immediately after the trade. Pittsburgh’s return for the league’s leading goal scorer produced 13 goals, 10 of which came from Beech.

Jagr on the other hand, was signed to a huge seven-year contract for the Capitals and continued registering points at an alarming rate — although it was pretty well-known how unhappy he was in Washington. They traded him to the New York Rangers in 2004.

4. Adam OatesThe trade: The Detroit Red Wings moved Adam Oates, along with Paul MacLean, to the St. Louis Blues for Bernie Federko and Tony McKegney (1989).

The aftermath: This was called, by many outlets, the worst trade in Red Wings history. Federko retired after a year, and McKegney only lasted 14 games amid some serious character issues in Detroit’s dressing room.

Oates was reportedly devastated by his trade. While his departure from St. Louis a couple years later was incredibly messy, his time with the Blues will forever be a highlight of his Hall of Fame career. He notched 90 assists in the 1990–91 campaign, most of those registered as the step-up for Oates’ hockey partner in crime, Brett Hull. The success of the dynamic duo left plenty to wonder whether or not Oates could have reached those numbers in a Red Wings sweater, instead of in St. Louis with the Golden Brett.

5. Brett HullThe trade: The Calgary Flames trade young stud Hull, along with Steve Bozek, to the St. Louis Blues for veterans Rob Ramage and Rick Wamsley (1988).

The aftermath: The trade for the other half of the “Hull and Oates” duo is quite interesting. On one hand, the Flames hoisted Lord Stanley’s Mug in 1989. On the other hand, that followed a downward trend while Hull scored 72 goals in 80 games in during the 1989–90 season, and 86 goals in 78 games the following season. Of course, that 1990–91 season marks the debut of Hull teaming up with Adam Oates to become one of the best duos that the game has ever seen.

How many of those many goals for the Blues would Hull have scored for Calgary? How many records would he have set for the Flames? Like the number of licks it takes to get to the center of the Tootsie pop, the world may never know.

Forget about bad weather. Here are the real reasons why the New York Yankees ticket sales keep dropping.

6. Marcel DionneThe trade: The Detroit Red Wings traded Dionne and Bart Crashley to the LA Kings for Terry Harper, Dan Maloney, and a second–round draft pick in 1976 (1975).

The aftermath: How does a player get traded after a 121–point season? The team they play for doesn’t like said player’s contract demands and ships them off. Such was the case for Dionne, as a contract dispute punched his ticket out of Detroit.

Harper and Maloney faired okay over the course of the next few season. But they didn’t make the mark that Dionne made, with five consecutive 100–point seasons over a decade of service in a Kings’ sweater.

7. Cam NeelyThe trade: The Vancouver Canucks shipped Neely and their first-round pick to the Boston Bruins for Barry Pederson (1986).

The aftermath: In the wide world of lopsided trades, the Cam Neely trade is one of the best recognized. (Although it isn’t as uneven as the Eric Lindros acquisition, but more on that later.)

It’s a simple tale. Before the trade, Pederson’s numbers were superior to those of young British Columbia product Neely. After the trade, all of that changed. Pederson’s number dropped during his tenure in Vancouver. Neely’s career flourished — tallying both goals and penalty minutes — and he went on to have a Hall of Fame career, star in a couple movies, and eventually be president of the Bruins.

8. Phil EspositoThe trade: The Chicago Blackhawks traded Phil Esposito, along with Ken Hodge and Fred Stanfield, to the Boston Bruins in exchange for Gilles Marotte, Pit Martin, and Jack Norris.

The aftermath: For as much as Esposito didn’t fit the program in Chicago, this ended up being one heck of a steal for Boston. He led the NHL in scoring five times during his tenure with the Bruins and established himself as a key cog in the B’s roster.

In fact the whole trade was profitable for Boston, with Stanfield putting up regular points and Hodge registering a couple 100-plus point seasons.

9. Wayne GretzkyThe trade: The Edmonton Oilers traded Wayne Gretzky, along with Marty McSorely and Mike Krushelnyski, to the Kings in exchange for Jimmy Carson, Martin Gelinas, three first-round picks, and $15 million. (1988)

The aftermath: Depending on what listicle you look at, this is rated as the worst trade ever to occur in the kingdom of hockey. No doubt because it is one of, if not the, most emotional trade to date. The fact that the Oilers won a Cup after the trade doesn’t even make a difference.

Canada’s greatest athlete and celebrity was shipped off to Hollywood, and Edmonton did not take it well. Like, Oilers’ GM Peter Pocklington received death threats because Oilers fans could not except it. It’s still a hot discussion topic whether or not the Gretzky trade was the first move in disassembling the unstoppable Oilers dynasty. Jari Kurri and Mark Messier departed just a couple seasons later, and others followed through the early ’90s. While The Great One returned up north and his No. 99 was retired and raised in Edmonton, there is no doubt that the trade of ’88 still stings.

10. Eric LindrosThe trade: The Quebec Nordiques traded Eric Lindros to the Philadelphia Flyers for Steve Duchesne, Peter Forsberg, Ron Hextall, Kerry Huffman, Mike Ricci, and Chris Simon, as well as two draft picks and $15 million (1992).

The aftermath: Eric Lindros was supposed to be the next big thing, a winning combination of every great player to ever inhabit the NHL. He didn’t want to play for the Nordiques, who drafted him first overall in 1991, and Philadelphia saw an opportunity. Lindros was a spectacle for a hot minute for the Flyers. Then injuries bogged him down and hampered his career. He never brought the Cup to Philly.

 The pack of juggernauts that the Flyers sent to the Nordiques, on the other hand, was the roster makeover that Quebec needed. The new-fangled squad moved from Quebec to Colorado, and became the Stanley Cup winning Avalanche in 1996 and 2001.

To start, to get the full price, you must be a student or military and have a login on the ID.me site. This is how NHL.TV verifies you. This will get you part of the discount.

If you aren't military or a student, you can still get a partial discount.

The second part requires you to change your IP address to a non US IP. I used PIA VPN to change mine to Romania (verified India and France work). 

Go to https://subscribe.nhl.com/international and you will see the regular price for multi-team viewing for the year dropped from 139.99 (US) to now the international rate of 119.99.

Now login to your troop.me or student.me account (buttons are at the top of the page). This will then drop the price another 35% to bring you to the 77.99 final price. Now when entering the billing address it doesn't give you a choice of the United States for the country. I just chose the United States Minor Islands and then used paypal to checkout.

I have about 5 years of experience organizing pools and fantasy leagues but with football and basketball, this will be my first time organizing a hockey pool. All of my leagues are well organized so although this is a first year pool, you can be assured that there will be no problems.

The rules of the game are you pick one team every saturday without repeating a team. If the team you choose loses, you're eliminated (ties count as a win). The last one standing wins. You are allowed more than one entry ($25 per entry).

I will be using leaguesafe to collect and pay money and we'll be using RunYourPool.com for the actual game.

I'm hoping to get the pot size to about $1000. If you're interested in signing up, please follow the following steps:

1) Sign up using the link below http://www.runyourpool.com/join/pool_info.cfm?id=78732&amp;p=survivor

Certain games from round 1 of the playoffs will be blacked out on 24 hour delay
All playoff games from round 2 onwards will be blacked out on 24 hour delay
ALL Stanley Cup games will be blacked out on 24 hour delay

Never really watched games, or rooted for a team. Fast forward to around 2013. A few of my friends are hockey fans, so I decide to finally pick a team. I live in Wyoming, so I feel like any team is up for grabs. I decide to root for the Rangers. I've been a Yankee fan since I was 14 (2006) and would often hear broadcasters talk Rangers hockey. So, why not root for NYR? Since then, I've been trying to be a true fan, but it's difficult not being able to watch games. I've decided this season to finally bite the bullet and get nhl.tv to finally watch games, and get invested in this team. Idk why I'm writing this. It's my first ever post on reddit. I'm not sure if I'm looking for validation of my fandom from the internet (yikes), or if I'm just writing this because it's 8 a.m. and I haven't been to sleep. Hockey is brand new to me. I haven't been through the pain and suffering, that most Ranger diehards have been through. Idk what makes a true fan, or if there's even such a thing. What i do know is, I care about this team. I love that they play in MSG. I love the red, white, and blue colors. I love the slanted logo, that I've never seen anywhere else.

First, I'd like to take a moment to thank anyone who may take a moment to read this; I appreciate it very much! In addition, I just want to give the heads-up that I did reach out to a family friend before the thought of posting here even crossed my mind; as such, if I hear back, I may end up striking this deal with him if he's willing; however, in the event he's not interested, I'd like to have a back-up. That said, without further ado, I'll jump straight to my reason for posting.

I have a $50 gift card to the [NHL online store](http://shop.nhl.com/source/BM-nhlcom-HP-main-nav), which I was fortunate enough to receive in a recent giveaway. To be completely up front, although I do enjoy the game, myself, I've only ever really watched for the actual Stanley Cup playoffs (when I can), and don't really keep track of players, stats, or anything else; I'm not a truly hard-core fan, so to speak, who watches every game and what-not. As such, if any fans are looking to make a purchase via the online store, and would be willing to consider helping out a person, I'd be appreciative for someone's consideration. What I'm looking for is a trade: I'd like to trade my $50 NHL online store gift card for something I'm really excited about - Hearthstone's newest expansion/set, [Knights of the Frozen Throne](https://us.battle.net/shop/en/product/hearthstone-knights-of-the-frozen-throne) (the pre-order is also $50); aside from the cards, obviously, I really do like that exclusive pre-order card back, and would LOVE to add that to my collection.  I recently chatted with a Hearthstone representative and they suggested one way to get the pre-order ""gifted"" would be via a Blizzard Balance card (which can be found in most pharmacy-esque stores, game stores, etc) - unfortunately, there's no way to out-right buy the pre-order and give that as a gift. Alternatively, if someone would be willing to send an email money transfer, I could out-right purchase it for myself.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration; I truly appreciate it!

So I am a relative pleb when it comes to hockey, and never really have had a favorite team. I like to watch the game, but have never really gotten into it as much as I have other sports.

However, I have just recently moved to Long Island, and am looking to learn more about the game, and determine what team to support.

I know both teams have pretty storied histories, and I'm excited to live in an area where I can see some home games for either team.

Would the Ranger and Islander fans on the sub be willing to ""sell"" me on why I should support your team? Or perhaps fans of other teams provide insight as well?

Sorry if this is lame. With the season starting in a couple of months, I'm just really looking forward to becoming a real fan of the game.

164,A Belated Birthday Wish - Seeking Trade with NHL Fan of $50 Gift Card to the Online Store for Hearthstone's Knights of the Frozen Throne Pre-Order,"Hello,

First, I'd like to take a moment to thank anyone who may take the time to read this; I appreciate it very much! I was just looking around Reddit to see if there may be any other place that may be appropriate to post this, and stumbled across this page. Hopefully this post is acceptable - as best I can tell, it should be! My birthday was actually a little while back, on May 17, so this is more of a belated birthday wish.

169,What if Patrik Stefan dont miss the Empty Net ?,"In 2007, in a Game between the Dallas Stars and the Edmonton Oilers,the stars was winning 5-4, oilers pulled their goalie and Stefan got a breakway into a Empty Net but misses created a turnover and the Oilers ties the Game and get 1 points.

With that point they passed the Hawks and the Hawks won the lottery of Patrick Kane !

But what if Stefan scores in the Empty Net and Dallas would have won the game?

First Kane would be a Edmonton Oilers and Sam Gagner and BlackHawks

So my guess is Hawks would be bad with Sam Gagner and they will miss the playoffs and finish second last, and get the second overall pick in 2008 Drew Doughty

And the oilers will most likely by better than the Hawks but worst than the real Hawks in 2008, so My guess is the 10th overall pick  Cody Hodgson

Let's fast foward 5 years in 2013

So in 2013 the Hawks Have Sam Gagner Toews Doughty Keith Seabrook,Saad,Hossa,Sharp,Shaw and since Doughty wont make 10,5M like Kane there is space for Leddy and Oduya, They won a Stanley Cup in 2013 (Like in real life) but not in 2010.In the Summer they trade Sam Gagner for some Depth

And for the Oilers, they didnt draft Hall,Nudge and Yakupov, but draft Seguin instead of Hall and they draft Oleksiak instead of Nudge and in 2012 they make the playoffs as the 8th seed and get rekt in the first round and draft Olli Maata then trade Hemsky for a decent defensman (A young Shattenkirk (Steal of the year)). In 2013, they got elimated in the second round and draft Theodore.

And now in 2017

In 2014, the Oilers won the cup because of Kane and Seguin.In 2015, they got eliminated by the Hawks in 7, In 2016 they won another Stanley Cup and 2017 Kane and Seguin are injured and they finished 4th last and got Nico Hischier.

In 2014, the Hawks got eliminated by the Oilers but they won agains the Oilers in 2015 to make the Stanley Cup Final but loose to Tampa Bay, in 2016 they lost in the second round and in 2017 they got eliminated in the western conference finals by the NashVille Predators.

So thats it if Stefan scores in the Empty Net:

Oilers win 2 cups
Hawks win 1 cups
Hawks first Line: Saad-Toews-Sharp Doughty-Keith
Oilers first line: Maroon-Seguin-Kane  Shattenkirk-Maata

And Connor Mcdavid goes to Arizona

Panarin will most likely not signed with the Hawks but with the Habs

173,[MHO] If Dominik Hašek had joined the NHL 1983 full-time and was healthy all along..,"He would have easily earned more than 10 Vezina trophies and a couple of more cups if he had played for more decent teams for at least half of his career.
This guy destroyed the czech extraliga from 1985-1990, earning 5 czech ""Vezina's"" and being voted to league MVP 3 times.
It's ok for him to stay on such a weak team as the Sabres, he still dominated the league like noone other. But imagine if he would have played for a strong team as a healthy guy for half of his career (let's say the Pens, Oilers, Blackhawks). The year Olaf Kolzig got the trophy, Hašek was injured and only played 30-40 games iirc.
This guy's skills were just unhuman. He didn't even start to be the starting goalie for an NHL team till he was 28 years old.",nhl,1502032507,dartthrower,10,2,True,2017-08-06

I wish for a return of [the 80s look](http://www.nhluniforms.com/Flames/Images/Flames01.png), but this is better than the last years.

**[Carolina](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5007b2ea84aef6ab9cd08134/5949f445e3df283dc08db06f/5949f917bebafb954cbcff59/1498020130079/cgy.png?format=750w)** - Probably Top 3 for coming out of this better. Welcome back checkered stripes on the bottom (albeit, a little fainter than before) and in the neck! Nice touch. All that is missing is [the white shoulder piping](http://www.nhluniforms.com/Hurricanes/Images/Hurricanes06.png) and these would be as perfect as you could ask for. 

**[Chicago](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5007b2ea84aef6ab9cd08134/5949f445e3df283dc08db06f/5949f91715d5db0d484a57dc/1498020130242/chi.png?format=750w)** - Same old classic.

**[Colorado](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5007b2ea84aef6ab9cd08134/5949f445e3df283dc08db06f/5949f91bf5e23116bf49f024/1498020133488/col.png?format=750w)** - If you're an Avs fan, you're probably really happy. I personally love the newer logo jerseys better, but gone are the body piping and the old style is back in business. In case you haven't noticed, if a jersey had body piping, I hated it. 

**[Columbus](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5007b2ea84aef6ab9cd08134/5949f445e3df283dc08db06f/5949f9133a0411096757668a/1498020125438/cbj.png?format=750w)** - Same old. I've seen some fan concepts that totally kill their jerseys, but that is a dream. Could be worse. 

By the way, I love what Columbus has done to their arena and the core of buildings and bars/restaurants around it. Great experience going to a CBJs game, would go again 100%. Can't hate the cannon, either, even if it does catch you off guard the first time :p

**[Dallas](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5007b2ea84aef6ab9cd08134/5949f445e3df283dc08db06f/5949f91c9de4bb4c20df6fd9/1498020135167/dal.png?format=750w)** - Was never a fan of the new logo or jersey. Still not. ""Victory Green"" on the inside of the neck.

**[Detroit](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5007b2ea84aef6ab9cd08134/5949f445e3df283dc08db06f/5949f920e4fcb553cd410126/1498020139086/det.png?format=750w)** - Same old classic.

**[Florida](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5007b2ea84aef6ab9cd08134/5949f445e3df283dc08db06f/5949f925b8a79b6e99b7ac08/1498020141843/fla.png?format=750w)** - Was never a fan of the stripe not going the whole way around the jersey. Doubt that has changed. Numbers on the shoulders = nope. 

**[Los Angeles](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5007b2ea84aef6ab9cd08134/5949f445e3df283dc08db06f/5949f9269f745653e9c0fbb6/1498020148433/lak.png?format=750w)** - Easily their best sets of jerseys since [the Gretzky era](http://www.nhluniforms.com/Kings/Images/Kings20.png). Thankfully, nothing has changed.

**[Minnesota](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5007b2ea84aef6ab9cd08134/5949f445e3df283dc08db06f/5949f92acd0f68296caeeff3/1498020148245/min.png?format=750w)** - Interesting. The red stripe on the arms really adds a nice little touch. Up there with Carolina for one of the better improvements. 

**[Montreal](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5007b2ea84aef6ab9cd08134/5949f445e3df283dc08db06f/5949f92acd0f68296caeeff3/1498020148245/min.png?format=750w)** - Same old classic. ""Nos Bras Meurtris Vous Tendent Le Flambeau"" (""To you from failing hands we throw the torch"") on the inside of the neck. 

**[Nashville](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5007b2ea84aef6ab9cd08134/5949f445e3df283dc08db06f/5949f92fccf210b0481aaaf1/1498020154967/nsh.png?format=750w)** - Can't fuck with those keys on the inside collar they've had since '11. Again, happy they got rid of the body piping. 

**[New Jersey](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5007b2ea84aef6ab9cd08134/5949f445e3df283dc08db06f/5949f92f59cc6808c3f2c7ea/1498020152021/njd.png?format=750w)** - White stripes on the arms got bigger. First time I saw it I had to take a second look. Inside of the collar, in green (niccee), the three Cup years. 

**[New York Islanders](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5007b2ea84aef6ab9cd08134/5949f445e3df283dc08db06f/5949f9348419c2cdfc93fb3b/1498020158175/nyi.png?format=750w)** - Same old classic. I FUCKING BEG YOU TO NEVER CHANGE. NEVER. EVER. ^please

**[Ottawa](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5007b2ea84aef6ab9cd08134/5949f445e3df283dc08db06f/5949f9393a041109675767c1/1498020164342/ott.png?format=750w)** - [Will you go back to the 90s already (or at least go back to that logo)?](http://www.nhluniforms.com/Senators/Images/Senators06.png). I don't know anyone that wouldn't want that look back. I actually dig the square arm design better now than the round design Reebok had. 

**[Philadelphia](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5007b2ea84aef6ab9cd08134/5949f445e3df283dc08db06f/5949f939579fb3c4e8d5304c/1498020163463/phi.png?format=750w)** - Same old classic.

Nothing on the bottom of the jerseys still make these look empty (like those first Reebok Leafs ones - yikes). Nothing about SJ's sweaters look good. Missed opportunity. 

**[St. Louis](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5007b2ea84aef6ab9cd08134/5949f445e3df283dc08db06f/5949f93e3e00beddf9371d33/1498020169240/sjs.png?format=750w)** - Keeping with what Reebok fixed from their first go (that fucking BODY PIPING), they add a beautiful design (city flag? anyone wanna confirm?) to the inside of their collars. Classic. 

**[Tampa Bay](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5007b2ea84aef6ab9cd08134/5949f445e3df283dc08db06f/5949f943e3df283dc08ddf15/1498020176704/tbl.png?format=750w)** - I, for one, think that this incarnation of their jerseys is the best in every way. So good on them for not messing with it. If it's not broken, don't fix it.

**[Toronto](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5007b2ea84aef6ab9cd08134/5949f445e3df283dc08db06f/5949f9472e69cf98d820a8b8/1498020177928/tor.png?format=750w)** - Same old classic. THAT BEING SAID, there will come the day they get rid of that one stripe shit at the bottom of the jersey and put in the normal two, and bring back the nine stripe socks. Never understood why they got rid of that - would have made for the best Leafs jersey ever. Ever. ""Honour. Courage. Pride."" remains on the inner collar.

**[Vancouver](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5007b2ea84aef6ab9cd08134/5949f445e3df283dc08db06f/5949f947725e25cad525751a/1498020176925/van.png?format=750w)** - WE KNOW WHAT CITY YOU'RE FROM. FOR FUCKS SAKE. GET RID OF THE CITY NAME. WE GET IT. 

**[Vegas Golden Knights](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5007b2ea84aef6ab9cd08134/5949f445e3df283dc08db06f/5949f94cd2b85721252f064c/1498020183716/vgk.png?format=750w)** - A mess. Like Winnipeg, probably not the best look to start the franchise off, but what can you do. Not a fan of anything really, except for all the details in the logo and sleeves. Reminds me of the jerseys from the last Winter Olympics. Maybe they will look better in person. Even though these [Canucks jerseys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEYS-kXpodE) had the opposite effect on me and I couldn't *wait* to see them. I must say, though, there is this pic taken in their team shop (or in front of it?), of a [mannequin dressed as a knight](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DCu7zJtVYAE3_fc.jpg:large). Golden helmet with pitch black armour. Looked fucking sweet. Good third jersey look? ""Vegas"" on the inside collar.

**[Winnipeg](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5007b2ea84aef6ab9cd08134/5949f445e3df283dc08db06f/5949f94c893fc010030617ba/1498020183709/wpg.png?format=750w)** - Shit jerseys with a secondary looking logo as their main.

Me thinks this might be a ploy that benefits both the Hawks and Hossa. 

1. Obviously, this would allow Hawks to put Hossa on LTIR and would be relieved of his 5.25 mil cap hit CONVENIENTLY when they are in cap trouble 

2. Hossa was probably considering retirement, contrary to his exit interview, but didn't want to screw the Hawks over. Why would he wake up every day to go to practice and play hockey for 1 mil for the next four years?


Something about this just isn't' right, and this is one of the most Blackhawks things ever. Sign a guy to a then monster contract only to later alleviate any repercussions from that monster contract.

The rumors of him playing for either the New York Rangers or Columbus Blue Jackets are absurd.  The Devils would never trade him to a division rival unless they were insanely over paid for him.  And why would Torterella want someone like Kovalchuk when CBJ didn't even bother calling up an offensive minded, scorer like Sonny Milano? Because Milano most likely wouldn't play well under Tort? THE ONLY option for him returning would be at 35 years old, when the Devils no longer have the rights to him.   And at that point- it'd be no surprise to anyone for the Rangers to overpay for a washed up star, I can see teams making him offers, but I would never see his offers being worth more than CKA.

Considering both will be 30+ years old when the season begins only makes this worse, I suppose once McDavid/Draisaitl are signed it'll be the 3rd highest paid duo but still equally as bad, even w/ Seguin/Kucherov making $9-10M a piece Seguin/Benn may come out a little more expensive but Kucherov/Stamkos will still be cheaper.

However, I have been living in Nashville for the last 5 years. At first, after I moved here, I still had a healthy hatred going for the Preds. Over the last couple seasons though, a genuine affinity has been building for the ""enemy"" Preds. And now that they are going to the Cup Final, this town is going completely berzerk over them. It does my heart good to see so many new people get interested in hockey. Granted, there will be a lot of bandwagon fans that will fall away over time, but, this team is creating many new die-hards of the future. 

My feeling is though, that I am betraying the 'Hawks on some level by enjoying the Preds run, and I kind of feel like a bad hockey fan.

However, the league has been absolutely horrid this post season. Multiple headshots have gone without even a fine. There are so many missed calls that are so blatant that it's hard to use the ""it's the playoffs"" excuse. I don't know why they even have checking from behind in the rulebook if they are never going to call it. There have been multiple goals that should have been called off that were upheld and vice versa. The officials in the pens vs sens game tonight didn't even look like they should be doing the memorial cup. There are so many times where refs will give a team a call just because they haven't had one all game. Tonight is a good example as to why you don't do that. At what point is there going to be another coach/player going ballistic on the refs?

tl;dr: Fuck the NHL and the officials, and start doing your jobs the right way

Edit: This isn't me trying to say the pens got jobbed tonight (although some could argue), I'm saying that officiating has been terrible in a lot of games for all teams, for and against. If someone were to go through and cherry pick, they can make any team look like they're getting all the calls, one way or another. 

Edit 2: To the kind people who are still coming in saying that this is a complaint about the fact that the penguins lost last night, the penguins didn't deserve to win last night since they only scored 1 goal, regardless of if that first one ""should have counted"". It didn't. The officials aren't why they lost. I'm addressing the fact that all teams this post season have been getting screwed, and that the consistency of calls and discipline to plays that should be fined/suspend-able is very much lacking.",nhl,1495595653,vinman91,85,36,True,2017-05-23

If you believe that offsides call was justified- I believe there needs to be a discussion of where do you draw the line? How far back can you go to review a play? That was a long possession.

204,"About the idea of ""Playoff Hockey""","     I know I made a bit of a troll-esque post just a few minutes ago but this time I'm looking for some serious discussion. 
     What's irked me most about every series of this playoffs-not just the pens series'- (and every playoffs for the past couple of seasons) is the idea of ""playoff hockey""- meaning that certain calls that would be made in the regular season aren't because it's the playoffs. I get the general idea of it-- you don't want games of this importance decided by a bunch of penalties, but I also think that this is the cause of a lot of the generally shit refereeing throughout the playoffs. 
     When the rules aren't strictly enforced and there's leeway with what's acceptable it means that the refs have far too much of an effect on the outcomes of games.  If the rules aren't concrete then what's the point of even having them (and I'm certainly not suggesting that would be a good idea). There must be consistency with the calls on both sides. Thats the only way that there is legitimacy in the game. 
     I think it starts with the announcers and commentators who seemingly defend this loose style. I think that this is by far the biggest issue/ mentality change that needs to take place in order to have a fun, exciting, and ultimately enjoyable playoffs. Just my two cents I'd be interested in hearing what others think.

First of all the questionable goal overturn call on an already outdated rule was a disheartening way to start the game. As the game continued there were questionable penalties being called on both sides. 

Another disappointment I have is with the majority of the coverage talking about how Nashville is the clear underdog. I feel like at this point in the playoffs the teams are evenly matched. Nashville had only lost 4 playoff games coming into the series and they had a sweep of the number one seed in the western conference. 

The one positive outcome I saw from tonight's game were from the players and coaches. Nashville didn't get sloppy or dirty when all the calls were going against them and they were down 3-0. Same goes to Pittsburgh when they didn't have a shot on goal for 37+ minutes.

Right now the players and the actual game of hockey are persuading me to continue watching this series because I'm very disappointed in the NHL. ",nhl,1496114067,teacher4400,1,15,True,2017-05-29
219,Offside Review,"Based on the current ruling that was a 50/50 call that personally I think should have been ruled inconclusive and counted as a goal. (I haven't seen a blue (edit) line camera angle yet only the crap they showed on TV) 

With that said... Was it really the entry into the zone that caused the goal? I understand if the preds walked in off the line and went bar down but they spent 15 seconds in the zone and retrieved the puck off a Pitt turnover. At what point do we consider the entry to be irrelevant?

Look at it this way. What if that 15 seconds was actually 2-5 minutes of sustained zone time? Does the fractional, ""oh he lifted his toe slightly"", offside REALLY have as big an impact as the defending team not being able to clear the zone?  

Unfortunate momentum swing early in the game but I think we're in for a good series.

Goal #1: It's a goddamn 5 on 3. Evgeni Malkin gets a wide open clapper from the high slot and fires it 7-hole at 90+ mph. If Rinne saves that, he's god.
-------
Goal #2: Beautiful play by the Penguins. Beautiful pass by Crosby to Kunitz in the high slot, Kunitz with the no-look feed to Sheary. No chance for Rinne. If he saves that, he's god.

Goal #3: Complete ass.
-----
Goal #4: This is the one that could be up for debate. I personally think it was a beautiful shot from Guentzel, top corner, with a quick release around Ryan Ellis. But he could have had this one for sure. Keep in mind it was the first shot he saw in 37 minutes.

At the end of the day, I understand you win and lose as a team. Rinne is part of the team, and obviously he could have played better.

236,[Discussion] Game 1 in summary,"I will be posting my opinion, however I feel it is important to state that I am a New Jersey Devils fan (and I cry in to my Kovalchuk jersey every night) and that I am not necessarily ""rooting"" for any particular team.  I am curious about your input on each individual topic below.

The offsides/ disallowed goal: 
The rules are the rules.  And the call was made accordingly, nothing you can really justifiably argue against.  I personally hate the replay challenge, and how close of a call it was in this instance. I also feel that the rule is not concrete.  In the sense that, how far back of a play without stoppage should you be able to challenge? The Predators were in the zone for a long time.  THIS call completely sweeped the momentum of the game clean- which was (in my opinion) favoring Nashville at the time.

The two penalties resulting in a 5 on 3:
The cross check from behind is an obvious call. The one in front of the net seemed to be the Penguin player slipping on his own, does anyone have any video showing otherwise?
This call shortly after the disallowed goal, completely threw the game off.  When they scored on the power play there was an evident momentum swing. And then shortly after I believe Sheary scored on a defensive breakdown.

Pekka Rinnes GAA/Save%:
The announcers were saying since he was able to see Malkins point shot- he should of had that one. That's a joke. It's Malkin, taking a wide open slap shot at the top of the slot........ stfu.  Sheary was a defensive breakdown, the own goal was unfortunate, and Guentzel absolutely sniped.  I don't believe his GAA/Save % from game 1 is relevant to how great of a goalie he is.  

The refs siding with the Penguins:
It's just not true.  There were a series of unfortunate events for the Preds, and it's a shame to happen in the cup finals, but it is what it is.  It's a best of 7, so there is no reason to panic over 1 bad game.

For me personally, it was becoming unbearable to watch after the own goal. It felt like I was watching a disaster unravel. I am hoping the refs will make better calls in the games to come.  It will be an entertaining series though.",nhl,1496168824,mvp047,5,20,True,2017-05-30

299,What now for Nashville?,"I thought they would win tonight and even the series up. As a sharks fan this is really reminiscent of last year and the run against the pens then.

Coming back from a 2-0 series is really hard to do. They need to win both games in Nashville to make this stay competitive at all. 

Rinne wasn't really the problem IMO, the defense was. They looked great in the first (the goal was just bad luck, he was in good position and it just slipped by) and alright in the second but by the 3rd the defense just seemed to give up.

Nashville never really had any offense other than in the first and I'm pretty sure they were outshot too.

If I was a Nashville fan (and for the next few weeks I sure am) I would want to see the following in this order

- More calm. They had 5 penalties this game and no powerplay goals. Taking a penalty just kills the time that you could have had to have some offense. Instead of crosschecking someone to the ground, how about taking a few more shots

- More confidence. Open ice (clean) hits are great. You guys basically let the penguins go through the neutral zone untouched by the 3rd. There were lots of 2 on 1 and breakaways. To be honest it's a miracle you guys didn't lose by more. 

- No blaming. The penguins are savvy. This is not their first trip. For you guys it is. This is just a series like any other one. The penguins are completely gassed, most are very injured. If you just step back and play like you did against the blues or the ducks you can put up a good fight. 

- Watch for speed. To counter the last point, you have to adapt. You aren't playing any of the other teams, you are playing the penguins. Adapt to them and don't pull a De'Beour and be stubborn. 

If the Predators lose the cup this year, (like the sharks before them) what will happen? Sure it will be a great accomplishment of ""getting there"" but is that really all they want? I hope they wake up for game 3 and win one. They need to win game 4 as well. Nashville isn't mature enough to fight back from a 3 game hole in my opinion and they will just get more angry which will = more penalties for them.

Ovechkin has made 1035 on 839 regular season games,(Ovechkin has played two seasons more in the NHL than Malkin). That gives him a 1.23 point per game. But in the playoffs he has a point per game percents of 1.0,Malkin has 1.13. 
Malkin has played more playoff games than Ovechkin and maybe on a better team. But Malkin plays as an center and Ovechkin as an winger. I would say its harder to play as an center. Ovechkin has also played belong side better players than Malkin,such as Backstrom and Semin. Malkin has been that player that leads the line and Ovechkin has been the player that ""finishes"" the line. 
Malkin is one of the best in NHL. I would say that he is just behind Ovechkin and Sid.

It's not like he missed some easy saves, the goal by Malkin is a beauty, and the previous goal was an own goal. Not to mention the very first goal by Gentzel which went through the hole of a needle.

Also, 3 out of 4 goals came from errors done by defensemen, and not the goalie.

The commentator says ""Gotta get Rinne out of there"". Is it common practice to punish the goalie when the defense is making mistakes? Or is it just superstition that he's responsible for them having a rough time?",nhl,1496394090,jeango,22,6,True,2017-06-02

I may be from Pittsburgh but I don't usually tune in unless one of our teams is doing awesome, like now. Well except tonight. Idk wtf was going on. At first, I would have chalked it up to the other team cheating somehow due to the amount of goals they were able to score in succession, but then I realize how easy it is to do that with enough effort. 

Idk. If worst comes to worst and the Pens end up choking and losing the whole series, I can at least take some solace in the fact that this will be the Preds' first Stanley Cup win ever. So at least they'll have something awesome to celebrate about for the first time. But what I DESPERATELY don't want to happen is related to the fans. Specifically, if the Pens lose, I hope that the Preds fans aren't a bunch of 1st grade bullies and shit on the Pens and their fans for losing. It ain't right and they don't deserve that.

So I signed up to NHL's online service, and while watching live games is great, if I miss one and intend to catch up with it later, I can't get to the stream without seeing a score and spoiling it for myself.

My only work around has been to ask my fiancé to put the game on for me... but she has a life, and I can't afford to get a maid just to navigate the NHL site.  So is there a workaround?

I saw the dtmts thing floating around, but unless I'm mistaken that's just highlights, whereas I want to watch full games.

44,Is there a precedent in sports for the situation between the St. Louis Blues and Minnesota Wild where a head coach -- Mike Yeo -- ousts his former team from the playoffs in the first year after they fired him?,"Or, to put it another way, how fucking embarrassing is it that you hire a supposedly better coach in Bruce Boudreau and then the guy you fired comes back the very next year with a different team and beats your ass in the first round of the fucking playoffs?

I consider this to be literally the best evidence that has ever existed in the history of sports that a team made a mistake in the hiring of a new coach.

To clarify, I'm a Minnesotan and Wild fan and god damned disgusted by this. And after the series' end, a series where St. Louis won 4 games to 1, [the Wild's new head coach Bruce Boudreau says the Blues ""weren't the better team.""](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/wild-coach-boudreau-says-blues-werent-better-team-011940602.html)

Fuck off Boudreau. Even if you are right that the Blues weren't the better team, that just reinforces the fact that you did an extremely shitty job of coaching in this series.

Why the fuck do you fire a decent coach if you're going to replace him with a coach who has built his NHL coaching reputation over 10 years on having teams that play well in the regular season and choke in the post-season? I'm not saying they shouldn't have fired Yeo, because there were problems, but you only fire him if you know the replacement is better.

Like I said, I think there's a strong argument for calling this the clearest evidence in the history of sports of a failed coaching hire.",nhl,1492947349,HAL9000000,9,12,True,2017-04-23

64,Question about the overtime penalty in tonight's Leafs vs. Caps game?,"Hey all - in tonight's Leafs vs. Caps game, the Leafs went on a power play at 19:13 so with 47 seconds left.

According to the [Rule Book](http://www.nhl.com/nhl/en/v3/ext/rules/2015-2016-Interactive-rulebook.pdf), on page 137 it says:
>84.3 Overtime – Regular-season – Penalties – When regulation time
ends and the teams are 5 on 3, teams will start overtime 5 on 3. Once
player strength reaches 5 on 4 or 5 on 5, at the next stoppage of play,
player strength is adjusted to 4 on 3 or 3 on 3, as appropriate. 

It does not say anything about in the playoffs if it carries over into the overtime, but it also doesn't say anything about it not, so I am assuming it is the same rule where it does carry over. In the game tonight, NBCSN did not say anything about a power play at the start of OT.

82,I'm here to cheer Allen,"(It's my first NHL playoffs btw)

I've watched some first round games (Pens mostly). There's a lot to write lol. Preds did amazing job, I guess no one expected the sweep. I didn't follow Ducks @ Flames and Sharks @ Oilers series, so I'm gonna skip them. Next are Rangers @ Canadians. It was nice to watch, close win. Senators deserved the win (at least in the last game). Bruins played chaotic, they lose the puck a lot and missed some chances.

There we come to Caps @ Leafs. I actually don't want to say anything cuz I've seen like two first games, but it was cool, I was sure Leafs would survive, but not this time :| I liked watching Pens a lot. There's a lot of Pens fans where I live (I'm an alien) and I decided to follow their series. I can't believe how they did 4-1 with those injuries. Anyway the crowd was great in Pittsburgh, we've heard you in Europe lol (TV actually, but shhh. It's our little secret).

Ok, so let's return to St. Louis Blues. I got a chance to watch their third game (3pm ET is like 9pm in my planet) and enjoyed it. The major part of the game that I loved was Allen (no homo). He was like a monster. How the hell he could see a 100mph puck in those li'l helmet holes lol. It was amazing. After those last three games I can actually tell you that he is the team and the score belongs to him. Of course, he can't score, but there were loads of chances where Wilds could throw the puck to the net. Those saves were unbelievable. And a few weeks ago (I just started watching hockey) I thought the goalie is just to cover the net, but he showed me I was wrong. Just watch recaps on YouTube. Great job, Allen.

I'm gonna follow both Blues and Pens. I'm proud of Preds, that's sad to fight against them. Wanna see the next sweep by Ducks (no offence, Oilers) and I actually don't care of Rangers @ Senators (again, no offense).

Have a great time, y'all. These playoffs are amazing so far, I wish it would never change. Sry for my English, I had bad teachers before switching to learn at home.",nhl,1493064834,KStef,2,11,True,2017-04-24

Option B may sound a bit nonsense and people may think I like hockey being called wrong but if we are literally going to analyze every play this much we may as well let them play and adjust the score after the game by me, not liking this addition what do you guys think?",nhl,1493602800,The_N1NE,5,2,True,2017-04-30

217,Fantasy NHL Redesign,"So today I decided to redesign the NHL. Totally for fun, I'm sure there would be problems with this if it was actually put into place, but this is essentially what I would like to see. Here it is:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OxqkAZNXXcA3tLag9SZI8chsmawqpqAqsH6mcjeFO3A/pub

Details:   
1) I cut it to 24 teams. I removed eleven teams and added four, mostly in Canada. I don't mean to offend you if you're a (for example) Coyotes fan, but I simply think franchises would do better in other places.    

2) Some teams (such as Washington) I wasn't sure about cutting, since they do have a fan base and aren't on the edge of collapsing or anything. But I think fewer teams is better, as it makes the league more competitive. Again, this is just fantasy.    

3) I largely retained the teams in the markets that have more of a hockey fan base. I know there's hockey fans in (e.g) Florida, but if I'm cutting teams, states like Minnesota have a much higher population of big hockey fans. Therefore, the distribution is disproportionately weighted on the North and Northeast. There are 10 Canadian teams, just under half the league. I did attempt to keep at least one team in each region- that's why the Avalanche are still around, so that if there's a die-hard fan in the western US, there's a team to cheer for.   

4) I removed the first round of the playoffs. This makes the post-season shorter and a playoff spot more competitive. I also didn't have a prerequisite of the top team of each division or anything- just the four best teams in each conference. If that means four Pacific teams and no Central teams, or vice versa, so be it.   

Again, this is just for fun. I don't mean to insult the fans of any teams I removed :) I just wanted to imagine a smaller, more competitive league. This allows rivals to play more often, the top talent to have to fight a little more for a spot, etc.   
Feel free to critique, and interact! What do you think? Which expansion teams would you cheer for?   

Two Side notes.  
1) If anyone is creative with design, I'd enjoy people's interpretations of logos and jerseys for the four new teams.   
2) The other idea I had is for two leagues- a Canadian League and American league. Each would have its own championship and then those two champions play for a continental championship. I may put together a fantasy league like this in the future as well.",nhl,1493658430,TwoLastNamesGuy,4,0,True,2017-05-01

Being this is an expansion year, the new team , Las Vegas, should have drafted first . Duh. Quite obvious. The expansion teams in the past were afforded that and there is certainly no reason for them to enter an Anti-tanking-lottery, when they have yet to play.

246,Rule clarification: Goaltender interference,"I understand that when goaltender interference is determined by video review, it only affects the goal/no goal call and no penalty is to be assessed. However, I've seen refs wave off goals due to goaltender interference on the ice but not assess a penalty.

Rule 69.2 of the NHL rulebook states:
> In all cases in which an attacking player initiates intentional or deliberate contact with a goalkeeper, whether or not the goalkeeper is inside or outside the goal crease, and whether or not a goal is scored, the attacking player will receive a penalty (minor or major, as the Referee deems appropriate).

249,"The real question in Caps-Pens series is not whether Crosby comes back, it's whether Holtby continues to play like he did last night.","As a Caps fan, it might be easy to be happy Crosby missed most of last night's game and hope he won't be back for game four, but nobody wants to win that way. It cheapens any victory. I hope he's OK and will be back tomorrow night. 

To me, the whole difference between games 1-2 and game 3 was that Braden Holtby was on his game last night, where he had been clearly off in the first two games. When he is on, those odd-man rushes and missed assignments by the defense result in great saves rather than bad goals. Even the two late goals the Pens got in game 3 both went in deflected off Caps players, I don't think you can blame Holtby for either of them.

I know people will argue, but that's my feeling. Holtby's play is what is going to determine the rest of this series, whether Crosby comes back or not.",nhl,1493739347,x2501x,14,16,True,2017-05-02
263,How does RFA signings and the expansion draft work fully?,"Can someone better explain how protecting/exposing RFA's will work?

They then offer them a qualifying offer and if they reject it and go back to their original team and that team matches the offer, they owe Vegas a pick right? 

Example (unrealistic but just for explaining purposes): 
- Tampa leaves Drouin exposed without having offered him a qualifying offer. 
- Vegas picks Drouin, receives his rights.
- Vegas offers him . . . $5.5m 
- Drouin goes back to Tampa, they offer him $5.6m, he accepts with Tampa.

303,[rant] Why the NHL needs to get rid of the coach's challenge.,"So your team just burned their coach's challenge and 5 minutes later another goal is scored against you, but the opposition was clearly off-side by 2 meters. 

In the next period your goalie gets totally bowled over by an opposing forward right before the opposition shoots the puck into the net. It's blatant goaltender interference, but it doesn't matter because you've already burned your coach's challenge.

So if the officials are incompetent or if they favor the other team, you're screwed. 

I'm really at a loss for words that we don't hear more negative comments regarding the coach's challenge. 

I'd really appreciate it if someone could help me understand how or why it got implemented in the first place, because it makes no sense to me.

Whenever a goal is scored shouldn't everything be reviewed automatically? I'm sure there are some people here who can remember when and why instant replay was first implemented. I think it had been around for 5-10 years when I was born.

If plays can't be reviewed to make sure that the right calls were made there's absolutely no point in having instant replay in the middle of the game.",nhl,1493869596,ThaddCorbett,10,12,True,2017-05-03

A guy behind him hits him squarely in the back.  No attempt to get to the side of him.  Hornqvist falls down and gets kicked in the face with another players skate inadvertently and leaves with jaw injury.  

I don't understand what is considered ""checking in the back"" in pro hockey.  In amateur hockey that will be a checking in the back or an interference every time.  If someone is stationary in front of the net can you just hit them in the back?  Certainly this goes uncalled a lot of times if the player doesn't fall down, not a critical situation, etc.  And tons and tons of cross checks and slashes go uncalled.  And we already know about goalie interference, whatever that is.  

I just don't understand what constitutes a check from behind.  The officiating can be pretty puzzling.

----> http://nhl321.club  <----

Take a look, let me know what you think!

It turns out that 3 point games would NOT have a huge (if any) impact on the standings. Certainly not enough that Bettman would want to change anything.

Feel free to check it out on [github](https://github.com/thejacer87/nhl321) if you want to help in any way. There are a few bugs I know of. It took a while to find a usable API. But its; still not the best I think, the change in standings is a little off, specifically for the conference standings.

18,Why a 3-2-1 point system makes sense but the NHL will never adopt it.,"**Why it would be good:** The 3 (regulation win) - 2 (overtime win) - 1 (OT/SO loss) scoring system would be beneficial as it places emphasis on regulation wins, seeing as overtimes/shootouts are basically a toss-up anyways. It doesn't completely get rid of the loser point, which some people like for some reason, but doesn't reward you as much.

**Why the NHL will never adopt it:** I can't see the NHL adopting this system any time soon because while some fans may enjoy the thought, it would space out the standings more which in turn would reduce parity. The league obviously likes when a lot of teams are right in the thick of things and this point system would kill that (to a degree).

19,Overtime vs Shootout to decide a game,"As entertaining as the shootout can be, you often hear that it's not a good way to determine the outcome of a game because it's just a skills competition. That got me thinking. Even if it is just a skills competition, as long as the good teams are good at the shootout and vice versa, would that still not be a reasonable way to determine the outcome of a game? And is four on four overtime any better?

I used data from the 2005-06 season to the 2015-16 season and looked at how teams fare in both categories. I plotted the teams winning percentage in games that end in regulation vs their winning percentage in the shootout as well as overtime.

I just realised that the last season of my data uses 3 on 3 OT rather than 4 on 4, but I doubt that it would change the results very much.

Anyway on a scale from -1 to 1, it looks like there is a correlation of 0.0726 between a team's regulation W% and their OT W% (pretty weak) and a correlation of 0.00884 between a team's regulation W% and their shootout W%.

So both of them are pretty weak, but the shootout has a correlation which is weaker by almost a factor of 10.

Note that I didn't do any analysis looking at what correlation you would expect just by chance alone. And I don't even know what would be the ideal correlation between the regular game and the way a tie is decided (I assume you'd want at least a bit).

Anyway, make of this what you will. Just thought that I should at least tell someone and this may be a good way of doing that",nhl,1490379444,lazykitten13,6,2,True,2017-03-24

Toronto, Calgary, Vancouver, Montreal, Winnipeg, NYR, Tampa, Carolina, Dallas, Colorado, Nashville, Detroit, Philly, St Louis. I think there is one more but I can remember it. 

IMHO, the best fans of the teams I listed were Toronto and Nashville. Both very passionate fans and that is followed by Montreal. Nothing violent hardly ever happens....except in the 1950's with the Richard riots. St louis was pretty good, Dallas was pretty good. Tampa was very good. 

Now the worst. Philly, IMHO, is the worst fans followed by NYR. I wore my leaf jersey in philly and got cat called, beer and nuts thrown at me near the end of the game. 2 thugs tried to start a fight with me and my wife, and we had our 5 year old boy with us. When I went to the NYR game, same thing with cat calls etc After the game, there was actually a guy stabbed.

167,An open letter to Gary Bettman,"Dear Mr. Bettman, 

Like many Canadians I am a passionate supporter of the NHL. I grew up watching hockey with my grandfather and have many memories of going to games with him. 

I watched as the London Knights won the memorial cup (even though I was a Guelph Storm fan) and followed players like Drew Doughty and Dan Giradi as their careers progressed to the big leagues. When I moved to Toronto I became a Maple Leafs fan, immersing myself in the great hockey culture we have here, often phoning home to have heated debates with my poppa who remained a Habs supporter til the day he died. 

Apart from those conversations I found myself talking to Habs, Oiler and Sens fan everytime I braved the cold in search of a beer and hockey. As a Canadian, walking into every bar you're bound to find a hockey fan or 12. 

I watched the 2014 Olympics in Thailand, where on a beach a million miles away from home I found myself amongst Canadians, who had travelled far to be far away from the cold, but all managed to be united in the joys of home by watching our teams skate around the ice. 

Mr. Bettman I am curious to know which ""53%"" of Canadians you polled to get your results? What questions did you ask to ensure you got this answer? Because I haven't found one Canadian since you broke the news that is happy about the lack of NHL participation in the Olympics. 

I like many of us feel that you continue to want to line your pockets. In a period where there is no NFL or MLB, the desire to want to cash in on an open opportunity with a sports market makes sense, especially as teams near the playoff seasons. 

But what is hockey about if not to unite people? What is the point of watching our athletes excel here, if they can't showcase their talents at home for their family and friends? Look at Lundqvist or Leo Komarov? What about the kids who get to see their idols come home? 

During the Olympics it doesn't matter if 8 months out of the year you aren't a Penguins fan-If you're a Canadian and you're watching Crosby you are damn proud that he has his roots in NS.  And no one dislikes the Habs as much as I do, but I know that I was cheering along with every other person for Carey Price in 2014. 

It is sad to see that the players desire to represent their countries doesn't supersede your need to fill your pockets. 

The amazing thing about bringing hockey to a global stage in the Olympics is that you don't have to understand the sport to want to be patriotic. As a Canadian you just fully understand that THIS IS OUR GAME. It's the one sport that unites us each and every Olympics and has us cheering as a nation. 

As fan's of the NHL we all rally against the other teams. We have debates in bars about our teams. We call our granddads and wind them up. We secretly cheer for Dan Girardi even though we love the leafs. But as Canadians watching on an Olympic level, we all cheer together. 

You have made it clear that the NHL doesn't care about its fans once again and I can tell you that this fan won't be watching a single NHL game while the Olympics are on.

I think it should be college players, not professionals represented in the Olympics. I don't care about whatever league drama or politics that prompted this. Just glad to see it happen. In my opinion, it is a good thing for the sport. I haven't been excited for Olympic hockey for years. Now I'm really hyped to see future potential stars get the spotlight. For anyone complaining that the amateurs will get killed, just remember the 1980 winter Olympics when a bunch of amateur Americans beat a professional hockey team on steroids. There hasn't been an American hockey game like that since. Now we have the chance again for some real sports magic. Not some NHL players who aren't willing to go all out because they don't want to be injured for regular season and playoffs. The only memorable moment I have of Olympic hockey with professionals was the [Nagano Olympics in 1998](https://sports.vice.com/en_us/article/when-american-hockey-players-destroyed-the-olympic-village-in-nagano). I seriously doubt an incident like that would have happened if it was college kids with the opportunity of a lifetime in place of professionals who have already made it. Also I would like to point out, both the Canadian and USA teams with heavy NHL representation (Wayne Gretzky was there kids) got spanked by teams with very little NHL representation in the 1998 Winter Olympics. So professional players doesn't necessarily make for a good team or good games. The pros have many opportunities to show themselves on the world stage, college kids have none, which Is unfair given their peers in other sports have the opportunity to play. I hope this change remains and the NHL keeps it's players out of the Olympics.

McDavid would be the fastest player by a mile and would leave guys like Bure and Coffee in the dust. This kid is the fastest player I have ever seen with and without the puck. 

There have been super fast players before, but couldn't score. Not the case with McDavid. His hands are as soft as pillows at top speed.

1. How many fans does each team has (doesn't matter, overall or just in your area - anywhere)? and also how popular the team in its homecity?

2. Rivalries (I know about Edmonton-Calgary and heard smth about Edmonton-Vancouver and Anaheim-San Jose) and friends (I'm from Europe and there we have some teams whose fans are friends w/each other)

3. Maybe, tell me the story how you started supporting them.

Yes, I know that I can wait for playoffs and look how these teams would go. But however, I want to know all these things I'm asking you.

I'm guessing it is, since going 0-0-82 will get you 82 points, which would've gotten you very close to the playoffs in 2002/03, as the Islanders got in with 83 points (albeit before the addition of the shootout). There's obviously the factor of all of those losses making the rest of the league's points total higher, but I figured there must be a possible scenario that gets an 0-0-82 team into the playoffs.

I was confused by this and looked it up to see if there was reseeding if the wild-card beat the top seed. Turns out he was wrong and maybe just confused but then I saw this. ""Home-ice advantage through the first two rounds goes to the team that placed higher in the regular-season standings. In the Conference Finals and Stanley Cup Final, home-ice advantage goes to the team that had the better regular-season record -- regardless of the teams' final standing in their respective divisions."" Does that mean, for example, if the Rangers and Canadiens traded point totals (Rangers would then have more but still be a Wild Card) would the Rangers have home ice advantage? Also, does this mean (if the Rangers win in the 1st round) that they would have home ice advantage against the Senators or Bruins? It seems to read that way but during the season, while the Rangers were ahead, I would hear time and time again that  the Rangers would play on the road to start the playoffs against Montreal even though they had more points at the time.",nhl,1491795049,NateB19,3,2,True,2017-04-09

I am going to make an 6 team set (at least, but wouldn't doing a 12 or 18 team set either), so we can make it into an NHL ""simulation"" game (each game takes about 5 minutes to play, so it allows for many different games in one evening, plus it raises the stakes a bit)

For each team, I will need player's names for five ""positions"" - as some of these aren't official positions so to speak, I am finding it hard to pick appropriate players... Goalie and Top Scorers are easiest, so if you could help me with the rest, that would be brilliant.

**Question 2: For the teams that I should include, which current player would you put forward for inclusion in the game for the following positions:**

* Goalie
* Top Scorer
* Enforcer
* Grinder
* Two Way Forward**

IMPORTANT: Game 1 of the playoffs starts tomorrow at around 7pm, so ALL payments must be in before tomorrow. I know this is short notice and that may be the reason this doesn’t pan out, but the whole process should take you about 10-12 minutes. As of now, the league is set up with a $10 entry fee.

NOTE: In the event that we don’t get enough entries by the deadline, this link is how the refund policy works: https://leaguesafe.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/217102206-How-do-I-request-a-refund-

385,A few things you might not have known about the Chris Pronger Oilers debacle,"If you don't want to read the whole wall of text just skip to the TL;DR at the end which will tell you what you need to know, although reading the whole thing might provide some additional input 


I know Chris Pronger's departure still brings up sour memories from 2006. We were a hair's breadth from winning the Cup that year, and even though we didn't, there initially seemed to be hope that we would be contenders for years to come. I was in Grade 8 when we lost and while many people were understandably sad after losing Game 7, there were also many hopeful sentiments and some of my friends would say stuff like ""It's OK, because 2007 is absolutely our year."" And at the time, there was still reason for hope. We had barely squeaked into the playoffs as the #8 seed that year, but during the regular season we had been riddled with injuries and prior to the start of the season many pundits were picking us as Cup contenders so really our run wasn't that big of a surprise. But then in a period of less than a year it all fell apart.

Pronger is hated in Edmonton for a number of reasons. First off, he was our anchor player at the time. While he may not have been a franchise player the way Connor McDavid is now he was certainly one of the best if not the best defencemen in the league at the time. A former Hart and Norris trophy winner, he made our power play absolutely deadly in the first three rounds of the playoffs before Carolina stymied it. With Pronger, the Oilers were a force to be reckoned with.

The second reason people hated Pronger was because he was the first domino to fall in a chain of absolutely terrible departures which ultimately gutted the team and set it up for its now infamous playoff drought. After Pronger left the Oilers were no longer touted as Cup contenders for the following playoffs, but with the remainder of the team still intact they were still expected to at least make the playoffs, and perhaps make a decent if not spectacular run. Instead, the team crumbled in a matter of weeks, with Pronger's defence partner, Jaroslav Spacek leaving the team soon after to be replaced with Cory Cross, who proved to be an abominable D-man during his tenure with the Oilers. Then, Michal Peca, who never really wanted to play in Edmonton in the first place, also demanded to leave. In only one year after the lockout and the creation of the new NHL, thanks to a few sparse moments of brilliance from Kevin Lowe and Craig MacTavish, the Oilers had built a Stanley Cup-caliber team and after only one season it was all gone. For the diehard hockey fan, the scenario could only be described as apocalyptic and the desolation was made complete when Ryan Smyth was unexpectedly traded at the trade deadline of the 2006-07 season after he and Kevin Lowe couldn't agree to a new contract. Soon enough, Lowe realized his blunder but the damage was done. The Oilers proceeded to lose their first 11 games following the trade, and were as a result knocked out of playoff contention that season, which would only be a harbinger of things to come. In the following 9 seasons, the 08-09 season was the only one in which they had even a legitimate shot of making the playoffs, and we routinely finished in the bottom three teams in the league during those years. Changing players, coaches, and general managers didn't seem to help. It seemed like we were eternally stuck.

The third reason why people hate Pronger were the murky circumstances of his departure. Pronger had signed a 5-year deal to stay in Edmonton and both he and his wife were reportedly very happy about the trade that brought him here. But suddenly after 1 year, he wanted out and rumors were spreading like wildfire. At the very least it seemed, his wife was not happy. But the rumors ran far deeper than that, with one common story being that Pronger had been having an affair with a young sports reporter who routinely talked to Oilers' players in the locker room, and that this fling had resulted in a pregnancy. This story was ultimately neither confirmed nor disproved but it certainly only fueled the growing resentment. At the height of the rumors, the Pronger family ultimately went on vacation overseas (I can't remember the exact destination, but it was either Hawaii or Mexico) to escape the spotlight. So Pronger betrayed the team and many Oilers fans believe he did so in the most dishonorable circumstances. This is one of the deeper reasons why even now many fans will struggle to forgive him, even if the Oilers win the Cup.

Finally, in the ultimate twist of poetic injustice, Pronger was traded to the Anaheim Ducks, where he was promptly made team captain, and won the Stanley Cup he had failed to win with the Oilers in his first season playing there. Even from a completely neutral standpoint this could not have been more unfair. He had brought great promise to a team that had been routinely eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Dallas Stars for most of the preceding decade after basking in its glory days and there was real hope he would bring some of that back. Instead not only did he fail to do so, but he also messed up mightily and ended up getting rewarded for it while the Oilers as a team ended up completely desolated. I think many hockey fans in other cities never fully understood why Pronger was booed in Edmonton for the rest of his career whenever he touched the puck and why even now, with his career over, with him being in the Hall of Fame, and with the Oilers back in the playoffs, many fans, myself included still dislike him. Well, now you know.

TL;DR: People hate Pronger because
1) He was the Oilers' best player and nobody expected him to leave
2) His departure set the stage for other players to leave ultimately causing the long playoff drought
3) There were rumors that he left because he knocked up a locker room reporter and it was the only way he could save his marriage 
4) He still won the Cup the following year while the Oilers languished in misery

Not giving another point of view, now THAT'S stupid. 

I will not call the other side stupid, it is a valid point of view. But so is this:

-Going back & forth from “regional” to “points” is getting boring, they have already gone back & forth before.  Regional ( current ) is preferable for two simple reasons. One, That is why there are Divisions, without it , the Divisions mean nothing & we do not want a league of just 32 Teams. 

And two, regional play has it's merits too, simply, if you think you are going anywhere in the Playoffs without escaping your own locale first, forget it. If you are Philly or Pittsburgh, you are going through the Tri-State area, or similar, first, or you are going nowhere.

Yes, sometimes , teams with more points do meet & it seems unfair but it isn't when you consider this.
No one cares how you finish. The LA Kings , 8th seed Stanley Cup Winner,  stamped that in stone. It is ALL new...no one cares how you finished, that is your own determination, not one that is objective. It is a clean slate, now. The inability of the President's Trophy Winner to win the cups is evident enough. Regular season performance is not a factor in the playoffs, period.

3,"First hockey game last night, I'm hooked.","I'll start by saying my family is born and raised in Pittsburgh, so they're die hard fans of every Pittsburgh team. Before yesterday, I've only watched 2 NHL games, on television. Yesterday I attended the Penguins / Redwings game in Pittsburgh, and it was literally the best sports experience I've ever had. I've been to several Steelers and Pirates games, and those don't even compare to the atmosphere of a Hockey game.

I'm not sure if it's because I had center seats directly on the glass or not, but it COULD NOT have been better. I should have probably started with this, but I had absolutely no idea about hockey before yesterday. No rules, penaltys, anything. The only thing I knew was Sidney Crosby was allegedly a beast on ice. Yesterday they celebrated Crosbys achievement of 1000 goals, and the whole stadium just seemed to be part of the same family. I learned so much from yesterday, about the players, how to dress so you're not cold throughout the game, that players give pucks away over the glass, and pretty much how to have fun (as odd as that sounds). The first period I'm in my seat being quiet, observing. #34 scored to make it 1-2 red wings, and I didn't say anything but clap. Once the third period started and we scored again, I'm screaming at the top of my lungs, excited as hell. I didn't care that we were down by 2, (I mean I did but whatever) we lost, but that didn't even matter at the end to me. 

Glad to finally understand why NHL is one of the best sports to watch, and I fully intend to watch every possible game I can from now on. 

Rants over, if it sounds like I don't know what I'm talking about, I apologize. I technically still don't know as much as I should, but fully intend on learning. 

Picture from the game: (not a good picture, just one of the few I took because I was too into observing, and I was focused on talking a picture of Hornqvist)

Why Marner isn't mentioned often in the Calder talk, when at the beginning of the season he was considered a big IF when it came to making the team is beyond me.

Last year, the 2 best teams in the NHL played each other in the ECSF (#1 WSH and #2 PIT) while the #5 NYI played #6 TBL. I know that they want (besides WC teams) the metro side to play out and play the winner of the atlantic side in the ECF. But doesn't that seem ridiculous? The Capitals and Penguins were by far the best 2 teams in the league last year, and they ended up playing each other in the second round. 
And with the Metro having 4 of the top 5 teams right now, it seems very likely that we will have the same problem this year. My suggestion would be to do matchups by straight up seeding. We can still have the top 3 from each division and 2 WC teams. But once the 8 teams are set, #1 plays #8, #2 plays #7, #3 plays #6 and so on. Then if both the #1 and #2 teams win out, they play each other in the ECF and WCF. Am I crazy for thinking that makes sense?",nhl,1487695056,_Cyantor_,95,100,True,2017-02-21

It had sections about the greatest players up until that point, a section about the time before goalies had masks and helmets and the history of that and so on.

I had this documentary, if one might call it that, on VHS. I've tried the search function here on the subreddit, I've stalked youtube for a long time and so on. I don't really expect anything, but if someone could help me find it, it would make my day.

135,Double Elimination format idea for the Stanley Cup Playoffs,"Hey guys I wanna hear what you guys think about a double elimination format. For those who don't know here's how it works.

There are essentially two brackets. A losers and winners. Teams in winners bracket receive two chances to stay alive in a tournament. Once they lose match in winners bracket they will be placed in losers bracket. Teams in losers bracket don't receive second chances. Once they loose a match in losers bracket they are eliminated from the tournament.

So here's my format idea


Top 8 Teams automatically qualify for WB. Teams 9-16 qualify for LB. Format for respective bracket would go accordingly. 1-8, 2-7, 3-6, 4-5, 9-16, 10-15, 11-14, 12-13. 

Round 2 would go like this. Team that loses their series in LB are eliminated. Teams that loose in WB will go on to face winners of LB teams. LB teams in the second round will face the the teams from WB with highest seed playing lowest seed and so on.

Example 

R1.

Winners Bracket Quarter Finals

1 (4) - 8 (2)

2 (4) - 7 (3)

3 (3) - 6 (4)

4 (2) - 5 (4)

Teams seeded 3,4,7,8 are knocked in to LB Round 1

Loser Bracket Round 1

9 (4) - 16 (0)

10 (4) - 15 (1)

11 (2) - 14 (4)

12 (4) - 13 (3)

Teams seeded 11, 13, 15, 16 are eliminated from contention 


R2. 

Winners Bracket Semi-Final 

1 (3) - 6 (4)

2 (4) - 5 (3)

Teams seeded 1, 5 are knocked into LB Quarter-Finals

Losers Bracket Round 3

3 (4) - 14 (3)

4 (4 ) - 12 (2)

7 (3) - 10 (4)

8 (3) - 12 (4)

Teams seeded 8, 10, 12, 14 are eliminated form contention.


R3. 

Winners Bracket Final

2 (4) - 6 (3)

Team seeded #6 is knocked into LB finals 

Losers Bracket Round 3

3 (4) - 12 (2)

4 (4) - 10 (1)


R4.

Losers Bracket Quarter-Final

1 (4) - 5 (3)

3 (4) - 4 (3)

Teams seeded 4, 5 are eliminated from contention 

R5.

Losers Bracket Semi-Final 

1 (3) - 3 (4)

Team seeded #1 is Eliminated form Contention 

R6.

Losers Bracket Finals 
 
3 (4) - 6 (2)

Team seeded #6 is Eliminated form contention 

R7.

Stanley Cup Finals

2 (3) - 3 (4) 

2 (4) - 3 (2)

Note that the LB team must win 2 series in order to clinch win Stanley Cup while the team from WB only need to win 1 series due to WB advantage.

This format has a total of 23 series (22 if WB team won first series) while the current format only has 15. I think that this would create much more parody in the Playoffs because it gives teams a second chance to make a run in Losers Bracket. Yes some of you may realize this format is from e-sports and we've seen teams make LB runs and my god is it fun to watch. I think this is good all in all because there's more hockey for us to watch.

Also for those who are planning to rip me in the comments please don't, this is just and idea and I want the best for this sport just like you do. I've loved hockey my whole life.",nhl,1488252332,Sixgod801,7,0,True,2017-02-27

Teams are given way too long to challenge and referees are given way too long to decide. Any ideas on how to shorten the review time? i.e. you have 30 seconds to challenge after the goal is scored, review can only take 45 seconds. If conclusive evidence isn't found in that space of time then it remains a goal. The challenging team clearly has an advantage from challenging in the current set-up, it kills momentum and even if they lose the challenge they just got what can sometimes equates to an almost 4 minute time-out ",nhl,1488332709,JiveTurkey688,5,4,True,2017-02-28

203,Serious question as far as picking a team,"Long story short, I was raised by people who were Flyers fans, and for a while I never got into hockey. Last year though when I was living with my grandparents I started watching Flyers game, and I thought I was a fan. But after the Stadium Series this past weekend, I got so fed up with them that I decided to stop being a fan. As sacrilegious as this will be to say, I've been thinking of becoming a Penguins fan. But being raised as a Flyers my whole life, I feel like the Pens are rejecting me like a bad sandwich. Despite them seeming better in every way (I even like black and gold as a color combo more...), and the Flyers being the closest team to me, I still don't know where I stand as far as team allegiance goes. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm still a hockey newbie and don't have strong feelings for either team, and need some help on figuring out which team to root for.

So I want to ask everyone: what is it that keeps you cheering for your favorite team, whether or not they've won 10 Stanley Cups or 0? Is there something about the hockey experience that I'm just not picking up on? What is it about your team that makes you go, ""these guys are awesome and they will have my full support until the day I die?""

Ideally I'd like to hear from both Flyers and Pens fans on this matter; I know they're one of the most bitter rivalries in the NHL, which is why I'm having even more trouble figuring this out on my own.

They all seem to go to the same teacher that tells them to repeat the same 9-10 lines in a different order when answering any question. I personally think its hilarious and would love to hear what lines you guys love most.

For example(taken from no particular interview):
Interviewer - ""What do you guys need to do tonight to get ahead early tonight?""

Player - ""I uh think it starts by getting pucks in deep and some traffic out front. Make sure we just take it one shift at a time""

Then they could ask something that targets the coach or a specific player's performance and wrap it right back to the team seamlessly.

Interviewer - ""It was a rough night out there for Jonathan Quick, what are you looking to do next game?""

Player - ""Ya know uh I think it comes down to playing disciplined hockey and making sure he can see the puck well. Going to just go out there and practice hard tomorrow.""


Some lines that can be given regardless of the situation:

""Get pucks in deep""

""Hard Forecheck""

""Traffic out front""

""One (insert unit of measurement here) at a time""

""Play a physical game""

""Shots on net""

""Play disciplined hockey""

""Stay out of the box""

""(Reference a player on the team, promptly end his name with an ""ie"")

My guess is the opposite side of the team's bench, is this correct?

Why are the coyotes planning to stay in Arizona?

Basically treat me like a 5 year old

Got a new shiny stadium, whatever, weren’t making any money, moved out of phoenix (the largest city in the state)
Arizona Coyotes, get a new shiny stadium rebranding, whatever, not making enough money, want to leave but may want to stay in the state, even maybe move to phoenix
Didn’t they start there? Are they just extorting the local governments for funding then moving, leaving the town to pay for an empty not so shiny stadium?
I don’t understand why the city of phoenix would want them back seeing how they seem to demand money up front, and will very likely bleed money till they leave. Why Not make the franchise pay for the stadium?

Hey everyone. I have a subscription to NHL.tv through DirecTV CenterIce and I just recently had to replace my laptop due to a crashed hard drive on my old one. Long story so I won't go into details. Anyways, this new laptop is an ASUS ZX53VW which is considered a low end gaming laptop. It has Windows 10 x64, 8G DDR4 RAM, 4GB DDR5 GTX960 and SSD drive and an i5 CPU. For some reason, NHL.tv will not play any games on any browser. The pages load and it gives me the buffering circle but then goes blank. I have the player controls in the lower right corner and I can right click in the video window to get Flash settings up but no video. I am overseas but don't think that is the issue since my last laptop worked fine. The only thing that has really changed is the hardware. I have tried everything on NHL.tv's support and even tried hardware accel settings on and off in Flash with no luck. I have updated Windows, drivers, and bios with no luck either. On another note, I can go to the game highlights and they play fine. Don't know why they work but the live games (or replays for that matter won't). I don't think it is a Flash issue since those work as well as other Flash sites like YouTube, FB, and even MLB.tv.

385,Complete NHL Overhaul,"This is an extreme idea for overhauling the way the NHL season is structured. It moves away from the current 82 game schedule in favour of a 62 game schedule along with stand alone in season tournaments to come up with the missing revenue that would be lost by removing 20 games. Here is how the scheduling works.

2 games x 31 opponents = 62 games. 
Top 16 move onto playoffs. 1v16, 2v15 etc.

My proposal for the stand alone in season tournaments would be separate Canadian and US national trophies. The format for these would be very similar to ensure all the teams play similar amount of games.

Canada - 2 games x 7 teams = 14 games. (adding an 8th team in Quebec city btw. Top 6 qualify for single elimination playoffs.

USA - 3 groups of 8 determined geographically. 2 games x 7 teams = 14 games. Top 2 in each group plus next 2 best teams qualify for single elimination playoffs.

With this set up each team will play 76+3=79 games at the most. The tournaments run mainly during the first half of the season, with the finals being held before the end of February, so not to interfere with the final playoff push.

I start reading people, perfectly, if I do say so myself. I was able to tell the actions they would take, the words they would speak, and the lies they would tell. My mind was still not finished. Eventually I could project my consciousness into another's mind, reading their thoughts and secrets, and tunneling them back into storage inside of my mind. I now how power over anyone I wanted, you know, having all their secrets with me. About the time I discovered this new talent, 10th grade was ending. I kept practicing during the summer. Eventually I was able to tunnel thoughts, secrets, and emotions from multiple people at once, kind of like a vacuum. I still wasn't done growing. I was then 17 in 11th grade, an extremely unusual teenager who had ultimate power, but I wasn't ready to exploit it yet. I started laying out in the yard after school, staring at the stars, focusing on one in particular, the sun. The more days/evenings/nights I stayed out focusing on the sun, then the moon, the crazier it got. Then it all got out of hand. Soon enough, I was able to project myself onto the sun, reflecting all over the earth. I was able to launch my consciousness to any point of the earth I wanted to, through light/reflections/heat etc. Fast forward a few years, I am now 24 years old. I have all the power in the world I need. I have transcended reality. You are safe for now, the world is safe, you all are my children. I am your God.",nhl,1490185563,WadAllDaFussAbou,6,0,True,2017-03-22

Where in Division 2 I can win 8 straight. So bringing back the tournaments they had a couple years ago where you can base your teams off of salary caps. I think they need to have to make this game more fun. Not everyone can play the top 100 guys cause the teams are ridiculous.

Whos parking lot you should only bring your car if you never liked it anyway.

There are no other major (NBA, NFL, MLB) sports teams in Vegas, it's not a popular sport in Nevada and the demographics of Las Vegas (irregular work schedules, high dependence on tourism) all combine to make the ""Golden Knights"" a dreadful choice for a franchise. But aside from that, the very name ""Golden Knights"" is atrocious. First of all, the US Army will not allow the name to be used, since ""Golden Knights"" is already the name of a parachute division. Here's a simple suggestion: the Las Vegas Vipers. It is geographically appropriate, since Rattlesnakes are common in Nevada, it has an assonance with the letter ""V"", and it has the potential for an appealing logo.

368,NY Islanders Relocation Possibilities?,"With the recent announcement of the (horrid) Barlcays Center killing its deal with the Islanders and the Nassau Coliseum's renovation cutting its capacity down to sub-13k people (not NHL ready), it seems the Islanders might be on the move. The only thing stopping a move is if they can build a new arena in Queens/Flushing, which seems unlikely considering the NY-area sports teams have all received new arenas in the past 8 years (except for MSG, which received a $1.2B makeover, which is like-new stadium money) involving all major boroughs except for SI. There would be way too many venues for the market to handle. The city and citizens can't deal with any new stadiums at this point. If the Islanders are to be relocated, here are the major options ranked in my opinion:

1. Quebec City, QB: The cream of the crop. Brand new NHL-ready arena in the Videotron Centre and an extremely passionate fanbase thats craving for a hockey team. Very profitable for the owners that choose to move there. I bet, if anything, this should be the best. Quebec has died to get their Nordiques back, and the Islanders may be the best chance yet. Odds: 60%

2. Kansas City, MO: The city has proven time and time again that it has some of the best sports fans in America. They also have the NHL-ready Sprint Center. Issues come with its small market size and sharing the same state as the St. Louis Blues, who own nearly all of Missouri's hockey fanbase, but could lead to a rivalry. Otherwise, KC could be a rock solid bet for hockey. Odds: 25%

3. Seattle, WA: Very passionate fanbase for most of their sports. No major indoor sports in the city and can embrace the team like they did the Supersonics. Plus this would align the conferences. Only issue comes with regards to a stadium, as the Key Arena is not suitable for a professional team at this point. Either major renovations are needed or a new arena is needed, which could be difficult considering the city has been very ho hum on that. Odds: 8%

4. Cleveland, OH: Very passionate fanbases, a huge amount of support for their own AHL Monsters (2nd in the AHL), and Quicken Loans Arena (which is slated for renovations as well) lead Cleveland to be a solid market. However, the market could be oversaturated, which would make Cleveland a four team city, which it is simply not. Interesting, but interest from the city is hit or miss. Odds: 5%

5. Hartford, CT: This move could work due to Hartford's hockey history and the Islanders fanbase would not be isolated, meaning those who supported the team will not necessarily be completely shunned. However, hockey failed in Hartford once, the market is easily the smallest out of all listed,  and the XL Center needs major renovations. Additionally, centralizing/keeping a bunch of teams in the north east may hurt the NHL in the long run. This move has a shot, but a very small one. Odds: 2%

Honorable Mentions/Odds <1%:
Atlanta, GA: It failed twice. It won't work again. The NHL learned its lesson.
Hamilton, ON: Adding even more teams to Ontario seems far fetched.
Houston, TX: Hockey in the dirty south hasn't worked all too well (see the Coyotes and the Stars). Another attempt seems very idiotic, despite Houston's massive market.
Milwaukee, Wi: Too small a market with too many teams, despite a new arena in the works to replace the Bradley Center. Also, the city is extremely close to Chicago, bringing competition from the 'Hawks.
Saskatoon, SK: Good market with no teams in Saskatchewan, but fans might be unproven and major arena issues arise.

383,Ticket offer you don't have to pay for.,"I have a ticket to the April 2 CBJ and Capitals game. Section 102 Row A, either seat 9 or 10.

Long story short, the dude I invited just broke the hell out of my heart, but I would still love to go to that game with someone since I paid over $500 for the seats. I'm not familiar with Columbus as I live all the way in Southern Kentucky, and it will feel weird being alone. You don't even have to pay me for the ticket. Just have fun and enjoy the game with me. Make a new friend! That's really all I ask. Doesn't matter who you root for either, just have a nice time and let me be able to say I stuck it to that idiot. Message me for more info.

PM me and we can chat. Pick the stickers that you want from my **DUPLICATES** list, and let me know which stickers you can send me from my **NEEDS** list.

All of my stickers are in great condition, and I'll send out right away.

Vermette got a 10 game suspension for hitting a ref on the leg yet when a star player leaves his feet and makes primary contact with the head using his elbow, DoPS is nowhere to be seen.

76,I saw my first NHL game as someone who's never watched hockey,"My family decided to see a NHL game today, and I decided on a whim to go just to check it out. I have never watched a hockey game before, and I am not a big sports fan. Unfortunately, I didn't like it for some reasons:

* As someone who doesn't watch hockey/sports, I didn't really understand what was going on. I thought an announcer was standard for sports game? It's been years since my last high school football game, but I remember an announcer being there.
* The constant interruptions with advertising. I understand people have to take breaks from the action, but I thought the constant streams of advertisements were incredibly annoying, and I think it would really ruin my experience even if I did like hockey, if not more. There were also really bright LED lighting advertisements (often in red) in my peripheral vision that were also very distracting. I feel like this would be a disappointment after paying $40 for tickets. How do you guys deal with it?
* There was this really annoying lady behind me who was constantly complaining, saying the players were ""playing like bitches"" even though she probably never had played a game of hockey in her life. I found it pretty disrespectful.
* One of the breaks ended up honoring some guy who had served time in the army. I find the association between professional sports and the military a little creepy and weird. 

Personally, I guess NHL games are not for me. I would not recommend it for people who are unfamiliar with hockey or not big sports fans. I'm curious for you guys who enjoy going to see live hockey games, why you enjoy the experience so much.

78,NHL Referee involvement in fights,"Ok I'm a Bruins fan and would like to bring up the Buffalo vs Boston game. Will Carrier hit David Backes in front of the Bruins bench. This post isn't about the hit but the Refs stepping in to a fight that they squashed immediately that was suppose to be a message of ""unwritten rules"" that fighting helps keep from happening. Again in the same game, McQuaid went after the player in a (in my opinion, bullshit glove drop)but here's were the NHL endangered McQuaid. They stopped McQuaid from fighting back allowing the other guy 7 straight punches to his face, resulting in bloodshed. 
This is bullshit. No one asked for less fights in hockey. Polls have the approval of fighting almost 90% yes.

So what's the deal? Are players just going to be allowed to make dangerous hits without misconducts and at the same time heavily penalize teammates for sticking up for the injured player? Should we wait for a superstar to get an elbow to the face to realize the enforcment of fighting actually helps make the player think twice about that illegal hit? I'm gonna watch hockey still and nothing changes but this really makes me question the path the NHL has taken in player safety by shutting down the one thing that kept assholes from making illegal hits.

133,I had a dream come true watching Brodeur play in the Winter Classic Alumni game on NYE,"[Pictures from the game](http://imgur.com/a/hG0bx)

Growing up in Minnesota, I’ve always been a hockey fan, but during my freshman year of high school I was watching the playoffs between Dallas (our old team!) and New Jersey and was absolutely mesmerized by Martin Brodeur. Goalies have always grabbed my interest (I loved to watch Roy and Hasek) and I became utterly obsessed with watching him play ever since. I made a large painting of him in art class which has been hanging up in my living room for the last 15 years. Unfortunately it took some abuse a few years ago but it is still in decent condition! 

One of my lifelong dreams was to see him play. I was never able to  quite get the logistics to work and when he retired I was devastated. So imagine my delight when I heard he would be playing in the winter classic alumni game! 2016 was a life changing year for me in several ways and I refused to miss out on this opportunity. I got my tickets, booked a flight and flew down this past weekend. Just seeing him in his gear (albeit not red, black and white was a little weird!), on the ice and listening to the national anthem was such a powerful moment for me. 

When the third period rolled around and he finally got to play, I was ecstatic. Seeing him, in person, between the pipes, was just an unforgettable experience. His skill was blatantly obvious even in an alumni game. With 4 minutes left, my cousin (who lives in St. Louis and is also a huge hockey fan) and I booked it to the lower level and other side of the stadium so we could see him even better and possibly get close to watch him go inside. When the game ended and he made his way into the stadium, it was almost overwhelming. I will never get over being 30 feet away from someone I have loved to watch play since I was 15. Quite literally one of the best days of my life!

318,The NHL has so much parity - should the system be changed to a 3-point system?,"It is really crazy how much parity the NHL has, and parity is GREAT its not that, its really cool how ridiculously close this league is. If we look at things, theres only 2 teams from western conference that appears to have lost their chance of a playoff spot (unless they play really well for the last half of the season) those two teams are Avalanche and Coyotes. Outside that, ALL teams from the west and ALL teams from the east are only a few wins shy of a playoff spot. Thats absolutely crazy to think about. That SO many teams are still in the mix. I think thats good.

But i also think the point system needs to be changed to a 3-point system like we see in the olympics and at the world cup. Theres much less parity on the national teams than in NHL so it doesnt even make sense to have the 3 point system there, but i still think its a great system that i think would compliment the NHL and make it even more exciting.

If you dont know, im sure most of u do, you get 2 points for winning a game now, 0 for losing, and each team are awarded 1 point if the game goes to OT in which the winner will recieve an additional point. This currently means, theres no difference between winning in OT and between getting things done in regulation. I think thats pretty bad. The only difference is that the opponent walks away with a point as well, but in most and many cases thats completely irrelevant. With the 3-point system you get 3 points for winning in regulation time, 2 for winning in overtime, 1 for losing in overtime, and 0 points for losing in regulation time. I think thats a great system. I wish there was an incentive to go for the win in regular time rather than accepting the game going to OT just to secure that 1 point first and foremost, i think this would be really nice to see and i think it would benefit the league as well. It would also be great to see the teams that are behind in the standings will now chase the win in regulation time and they will ""risk it all"" to get things done in regulation to get that extra point, thats gonna be nice and will create some exciting games, and maybe this approach will pay off and will eventually push you ahead of the teams that are just playing it safe so to speak by being okay with grabbing just the 1 point in most of their games. I just think a 3 point system would suit and compliment this current league we have now much more, its almost as if that system is taylor-made for the NHL.

British here, and my football team that I've supported my entire life looks like it's going to go down the pan due to a dodgy owner (more than likely) putting us into liquidation in the not-too-distant future. My team were never good (despite one season recently where we got to a play-off final in the third tier of English Football, another where we beat a top-flight team in the third round of the cup...) and are generally a bit rubbish. I'm more than happy with that in my life, as I feel that it offers sound lessons in life.

A few weekends ago I went to see our local Ice Hockey team play as my football team were away at some place I'd already been to countless times before and fancied not seeing us get humped (spoiler: we got humped). I really enjoyed the game, and although the home team lost 6-0 (a feeling I'm fairly used to) and I knew I wasn't exactly watching top-quality stuff, felt it was something to pursue.

I would like a side that 'does things the right way' (as much as North American sports can be - to the impartial observer, it looks as if everything is always MONEY MONEY MONEY), put a shift in, play fairly expressive stuff but generally never really get anywhere.

Watched a few games this week - Flyers get destroyed by the Capitals, Ducks v Avalanche and the Canadiens last night. Tried to get into NHL a few years back through the Canadiens, but I'm led to believe that they're a bit arrogant on account of having won everything a lifetime ago.

53,"When it comes to being a hockey (or sports) fan, how important is a personal connection to a team?","My dad loves the Dallas Cowboys. It's not simply because he likes the way they play or thinks they have a strong team. He likes them because he grew up watching the Cowboys his entire life. He has a deeply emotional and personal connection to the team.

Not really being a fan of sports other than hockey - and even then, I'm just a casual fan - I don't have that same connection to any sports team. I love the Predators, but part of that is just that they're the local team (well, I guess the Blues are, too). If I were to deeply invest in watching hockey as a hobby, the team I would like the most would be the team I enjoy watching the most. Having little viewing experience, my favorite teams are the Preds and the Sharks at the moment.

But I do feel like I'm missing out on something because I'm not deeply connected to a team. My dad gets really passionate when watching the Cowboys play, but when I watch the Predators play, I watch it more like a movie than as a lifelong fan. I obviously cheer when they score, but I don't get super pissed off when they lose or hold any hatred towards any of their rivals. That seems good to an extent, but I do feel like I'm not getting as strong of an experience as I would if I had been a passionate Predators fan since I moved to Tennessee as a kid.

For those of you who do have that close connection to a team or teams, how important is that to you? Does it enhance the viewing experience in any way? Does it have drawbacks?

210,"On Nolan Patrick's Sports Hernia Issues, and the Problem It Presents.","On Nolan Patrick's sports hernia injury issue:

Patrick played through the final weeks of his 2015-16 campaign with a sports hernia that required immediate surgery. While I commend him for having the courage to play through the injury, evidently it was an issue that bothered him; it could also have potential long-term effects. My assessment of his game factors in mostly matches played before the hernia. During the second half of last season, there was a debate about whether Pierre-Luc Dubois was a better prospect than Patrick. The consensus appears to have been that Patrick would have been ranked 5th to 10th in last year's draft. Healthy or not, he still does not display the kind of dynamic offensive ability or creativity that a bona fide first-line center is expected to possess.

>While some of the scouts surveyed by TSN do not discount Patrick evolving into that role, the consensus view is Patrick is projected more as a second-line NHL centre and doesn't have the same “wow” factor as McDavid, Eichel and Matthews.

>""He's going to be a good, maybe very good, NHL player,"" one scout said, ""but he isn't a dynamic player. His skating isn't bad but he's not dynamic like those others [McDavid, Eichel and Matthews].""

>Patrick's birthday is Sept. 19, so he was just four days off being eligible for last season's draft. Had he been available last June, where would he slot amongst the best players of a very strong draft class, like Matthews, Patrik Laine, Jesse Puljujarvi and Pierre-Luc Dubois, among others?

>The consensus amongst scouts surveyed by TSN is that Patrick wouldn't have displaced any of the top four picks in last year's draft. Depending on the scout, they retroactively rank Patrick anywhere between No. 5 and 10, based on his 2015-16 season.

But none played particularly well, although Quenneville scored a spectacular between-the-legs goal early in the tournament against Rouyn-Noranda.

>Still, there was a lot of focus on Patrick, and he wasn’t able to score at all in the tournament or assert himself in any of the games, ending up with just one assist and 11 shots in three games for a Brandon team that only scored five goals in the tournament. Patrick seemed uncertain at times, not surprising in an event where much older players usually dominate.

With the injury, he became entirely ineffective. It has also opened the door to other concerns.

One has to wonder if playing through a sports hernia will have any lasting effects on his career. Not only did he play through it, but he ran into complications with it early this season.

For a player that is trying to earn a new contract, you'd expect to see a lot more than what Andrew Ladd has brought to the table.

>While Ladd is asking for a long-term extension (reportedly around 6 years) in contract negotiations, his performance isn't pleading his case very well. Yes, on the last few scoresheets Ladd has put a Band-Aid over his disappointing season. He has 5 assists in his last 6 contests, but has been held without a goal for the last 11 games. It's not like Ladd hasn't been the same for just spurts of this season. Ladd hasn't been himself for a little while, dating back to the end of last season.

>Last year in the Jets first round playoff series against the Anaheim Ducks, Ladd was widely criticized for his performance. He looked sluggish and banged up, and was practically invisible most of the games.

>Something was evidently not right with the Jets captain. It was revealed after the series that Ladd had suffered a sports hernia and was playing through it during the last part of the season. Since around that point, Ladd's production has taken a significant drop off. Could his struggles be due to lingering effects from the sports hernia surgery he's recovering from?

>...

>According to a study done by the American Journal of Sports Medicine, players who have played over 7 full seasons (Ladd has 11 in the NHL under his belt) return from sports hernia injuries with a significant decrease in their overall performance levels.

>...

>Another example, Ladd's junior teammate Ryan Getzlaf, also had a sports hernia at the end of last season. He did not need surgery, but the effects of the injury are taking a huge toll on his production as well. Getzlaf is a surefire NHL superstar and has been amongst the best in the league over the last couple of years. He has 3 goals so far this season. He's on pace for under 10.

>Both Ladd and Getzlaf have played well over 7 seasons in the NHL, and both are fitting into the criteria of veteran players having production drop-offs after suffering a sports hernia.

>... 

Many consider Patrick to be a future second-line center in the NHL on the condition that he is entirely healthy, but a problematic sports hernia might be another concern. Some players return and are fine, but Nolan hasn't even been drafted yet and has mishandled his injury. To spend several weeks active and in pain with a sports hernia is a serious mistake. Apparently, he didn't tell anyone about it, although his on-ice performance spoke volumes; furthermore, he has missed a significant part of the current season with complications.

>‘Sports hernia’ is a condition of **chronic** exercise-related supra-inguinal groin pain which is associated with an incipient direct bulge of the inguinal wall whenever the abdominal muscles contract forcefully. **This limits athletic performance and can be a ‘career-ending’ injury.**

>...

>Symptoms

>Sports that are most often affected involve kicking and/or rapid acceleration with an accompanying sudden change in direction (e.g. soccer, rugby, AFL, ice hockey, martial arts). The pain develops during exercise, is generally unilateral but occasionally bilateral, and is typically located in the supra-inguinal portion of lower abdomen lateral to rectus abdominis, sometimes radiating to the testis (Fig 1, solid arrows). Importantly, it does not reach the pelvic midline, but can often radiate into the medial thigh along the path of adductor longus (Fig 1, dotted arrows). **Sports hernia pain is often aggravated by sudden acceleration, twisting and turning, cutting and kicking, coughing and/or sneezing, and sit-ups.** The pain generally persists after a game, with accompanying stiffness and difficulty getting out of bed the following day. In most cases, the initial onset is insidious. However, in about one third of cases, the patient recalls a sudden ‘tearing’ sensation at the time of initial symptom onset [1]. **Despite any period of rest or lay-off, Sports hernia pain returns immediately and with full force upon resumption of sport.**

>Physical findings

>The overwhelming majority of patients are young adult males. Objective physical examination findings are typically sparse. A palpable cough impulse is either weak or absent. A subtle bulge in skin surface contour can occasionally be seen over the affected inguinal region when observed from above with the patient standing. Pain may be evoked with a resisted abdominal ‘crunch’ and tenderness elicited most commonly over the conjoint tendon immediately superomedial to pubic tubercle. Many patients also exhibit tenderness over the ipsilateral adductor longus origin and/or have a positive adductor ‘squeeze’ test in bent knee position (pain and inhibition when asked to squeeze the legs together against resistance).

As with any player who suffers a major injury, I think that there should be an awareness of potential problems in the future. He isn't exactly a player with a clean medical record, and he's not a very dynamic player to begin with.

Yesterday, it was announced that he would not participate in the 2017 World Junior Championship.

239,Nolan Patrick Has Been Injured At Some Point in Each of the Last Five Seasons. He is Injury-Prone.,"It seems that few are aware of the circumstances regarding top prospect Nolan Patrick's current absence from hockey. He is currently battling through a sports hernia-related injury that was operated on this past off-season. This is not the only injury he has been forced to deal with, however, nor is it the first time he has dealt with an extended ""day-to-day upper-body injury.""

As a follow-up to my post on Nolan Patrick's current sports hernia problem [(which you can read here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/5gu4jv/on_nolan_patricks_sports_hernia_issues_and_the/), I continued to investigate. I had heard from a few people that Nolan Patrick's medical history was not very clean, but upon digging further, I discovered that he has been injured in every single season dating back to 2012-13, at the very least.

It seems that he is injury-prone, which would raise major concerns for any team looking to select a player with whom to build their future. He has suffered several upper-body injuries in the past. Below is his recent history with injuries.

In **2012-13**, he suffered a shoulder injury and missed half of the season.

Of course, he suffered the current sports hernia injury last April (April 2016). **This means that he has been injured at some point in every one of his last five seasons (2012-13, 2013-14, 2014-15, 2015-16, 2016-17).**

With regards to this injury, he might have groin (lower abdomen) issues, which is what he has battled over the past few seasons. He had ""day-to-day lower/upper-body issues"" that lasted for a month in February and March 2015 (2014-15), then a sports hernia injury in April 2016 (2015-16), and again ""day-to-day upper-body issues"" relating to the sports hernia since October 14, 2016 to the present day (2016-17). He played through it in April and May 2016 when he needed surgery; this could have caused further problems.

To spend several weeks active and in pain with a sports hernia is a serious mistake. He severely mishandled this injury. Apparently, he did not tell anyone about it; furthermore, he has missed a significant part of the current season with complications and may confront potential long-term consequences.

 November, the Las Vegas NHL hockey franchise, which will begin playing with the National Hockey League (NHL) in the 2017-18 season, announced that it would be known as the Golden Knights. The decision followed recent news reports that the franchise had trademarked a series of names, including Desert Knights and Silver Knights, and many assumed that this would be the last word regarding the team’s name and logo.
On December 7th, however, an office action issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office indicated that the USPTO had refused the registration of U.S. Trademark Application No. 87147239, which would have protected the use of the standard character mark of “VEGAS GOLDEN KNIGHTS” on entertainment services, specifically professional ice hockey exhibitions. The refusal was issued by a trademark examiner because of a concern over what is known as “likelihood of confusion.” In this case the trademark examiner believed there would be a potential likelihood of confusion if the NHL hockey franchise registered GOLDEN KNIGHTS due to an already existing registered trademark held by the College of Saint Rose in Albany, NY. That school holds a trademark, which includes the phrasing GOLDEN KNIGHTS for use with intercollegiate sports exhibitions. The trademark examiner felt registering the Las Vegas NHL hockey franchise’s trademark could be confusingly similar given the overlap in phrasing and the prominence of GOLDEN KNIGHTS in either mark.
An official statement released by the Las Vegas Golden Knights indicates that the franchise intends to respond to the office action by next June’s deadline and that such office actions refusing registration are not that unusual, which is true. Indeed, while most of the popular press has reported that the trademark has been denied by the USPTO, that is simply not true as of this point. The trademark examiner has raised concerns and is refusing registration. The applicant now has the right to respond and try and convince the trademark examiner to reconsider. Even if unsuccessful in dealing with the trademark examiner the Las Vegas NHL team would still have multiple layers of recourse through appeals if they wanted to pursue the matter further. 
A quick skim of the wider world of sports reflects the fact that it should not be too difficult for Las Vegas to make the case that both trademarks can coexist. In the four major professional team sports leagues operating in the U.S., there are multiple examples of teams using similar nicknames. For example, the NHL’s New York Rangers franchise uses the same name as Major League Baseball’s (MLB) Texas Rangers franchise. The NHL’s Los Angeles franchise and Sacramento’s National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise are both known as the Kings. Other examples of sports team name overlaps include Panthers (NHL’s Florida franchise and National Football League’s (NFL) Carolina franchise); Giants (NFL’s New York franchise and MLB’s San Francisco franchise); and Jets (NFL’s other New York franchise and NHL’s Winnipeg franchise). There are no doubt other examples of two teams using the same name.
Perhaps an even better example of a team name existing in multiple sports leagues at both the professional and collegiate level is the Cardinals. MLB has the St. Louis Cardinals and the NFL includes the Arizona Cardinals. Further, the NCAA has multiple colleges which use the Cardinals nickname: the University of Louisville, Ball State University and Lamar University are just a few examples of this. Stanford University is known as the Cardinal (singular) for the color not the bird, but in the world of trademark law and likelihood of confusion the presence or absence of an “s” would likely make a huge difference, or so it would seem.
Of course, even without trademark registration, the Las Vegas team could still use the Golden Knights moniker in commerce. This point was underscored by a recent amicus brief filed by the American Bar Association with the U.S. Supreme Court on a case involving disparaging trademarks. Although there are real benefits to having a trademark listed on the USPTO’s principal register, the ABA noted that unregistrable marks still have some federal protections under the Lanham Act to prevent either consumer confusion or misrepresentation of the geographic origin of goods.

395,Who is the best hockey play ever?,"I was having this conversation with a few people at a game recently. Of course most people immediately just said Gretzky. There was one guy however who said that Mario Lemieux was most likely the best player. It's some what of a subjective question but it can be grounded in the stats. 

I did a little research into the career stats of some of the best players ever. The stat that really jumps out to me as the most important is not total points or most points in a season but instead it is the points per game average. The great one Gretzky is still number one in this stat with a massive 1.921 ppg. Surprisingly, Lemieux is a very close second with 1.883 ppg. Lemieux was plagued with injuries and illness during his career which limited the amount of games he was able to play. The third place is Mike Bossy with 1.497 ppg so both Lemieux and Gretzky are in another league from everyone else.

We also have to ask ourselves do we really believe all points are equal. Do you think a player that has 20 goals and 60 assists is just as good as a player that has 60 goals and 20 assists? If you value goal scoring more you will see that Steve Bossy has the highest goals per game average with .762 followed by Lemieux in a close second with .754. Gretzky is only 4th with .601. Lemieux is also first in playoff goals per game. If you take the 82 game season and use the numbers, Gretzky's average season is 49.2 goals and 108.2 assists while Lemieux's is 61.5 goals and 92.6 assists. Lidstrom said Lemieux was the best player he ever played against including Gretzky.

If this arena is approved, it's very likely that the NBA will return to Seattle, and the NHL will probably follow.
Now I know this isn't a guarantee, but lets say it does happen. We all know the new NBA team will be called the Seattle SuperSonics (what other name could possibly work?), but what would an NHL team be called.
I have a few ideas, tell me what you think. If you have any ideas of your own tell me, I'd like to hear them.
Seattle Cascades I think this one makes sense because Seattle is situated near the Cascades mountains, the Cascades mountains are known for being snowy in the winter, and hockey is a winter sport.
Seattle Pines-Given the large amount of pine trees in the PNW, this makes sense.
Seattle Metropollins-Seattle did have an NHL team at one point (long story) and this is what they were called. This name would be ok, but it sounds kind of generic. Nothing about it really sounds unique to Seattle, although I can see why people would want that name.

199,I have Cursed the Dallas Stars,"The date was February 15th, 2016 and the Dallas Stars and the Nashville Predators were locked in a back and forth battle on ice until 60 minutes were not enough to declare a victor. With a minute left in OT, the Stars caught their opponents off guard on an odd man rush and there was no more hope left in the Brdigestone Arena. It was in that final minute that the game was decided by a rebound goal by no other, but Mattias Janmark.

Before heading into Overtime I made a pact with my friends that I would purchase a jersey of whichever player won the game for the Stars. I was happy it was Janmark. Who buys a Janmark jersey? ""Me. I do,"" I told myself. I feverishly checked the Dallas Stars online store and what was happiness quickly turned to sadness when I saw the price for a jersey. I thought about buying a rip off, but then I thought, ""You have to do this right. The jersey has to be real."" I started to save money, but soon I forgot about the jersey. It became a legend, a lost inside joke between my friends and I. But it wouldn't remain hidden for long.

That same season of the Janmark goal the Stars won the Central Division and made the playoffs. They embarrassed the Wild and headed to the second round to face off versus the St. Luis Blues. The Dallas players put up one hell of a fight throughout the series until Game 7. This was when the Curse reared its ugly head and the Stars fell 6 to 1.

After this tragedy, the Curse became more apparent to me. It was the reason for Seguin's injury, the Game 7 disappointment, the reason for our 5 losses this season and for all of the recent team injuries, including none other than Mattias Janmark.

I have cursed the team. I am the Plague upon my most beloved sports team and I want it to stop. I know I screwed up and you can blame everything on me. I understand. But if you love the Dallas Stars as much as I do, please help me break this curse. Below will be my venmo account. Every penny helps my situation - nay, our situation as Dallas Stars fans.

217,Watching NHL games from the UK,"I've been a casual hockey fan for a few years now, but got well and truly sucked into it for real about 10 months ago after being repeatedly disheartened by football (soccer) over here.

Anyway, I've tried a few different ways to watch the NHL in the uk, through catching games on YouTube (but the NHL seems to be really cracking down on this), to subscribing to premiersports (but the service is SHIT and if a game goes on for longer than they're expecting they often chop the last bit out), to finally biting the bullet and subscribing to nhl.tv. 

It's okay for what I need - I can catch all the games and if this is not live it tends not to matter as puck drops are often 1-3am here. However, I'm having a hard time being able to watch it on my tv via anything other than hooking my tv up to my computer.

In that regard, one of the things that's confused me and I've been unable to clarify (I can't seem to find the relevant sections in the rulebook) is overlapping penalties.  That is, Buffalo's Evander Kane takes a 2 minute minor for hooking.  30 seconds into the Devils power play, the Devils' Jacob Josefson takes a 2 minute minor for tripping.  The teams are now 4v4.  If one of the teams scores, shouldn't the relevant penalty (i.e. if the Devils score, Kane's penalty) end?  Why do the teams stay 4v4?  Can someone expand on this and/or point me to the relevant sections of the rulebook?

247,Rules question: Scoring on a delayed penalty while shorthanded,"Had a long debate about this a while back, and never really came to a satisfactory answer.

For a control scenario: two teams are playing at even strength 5v5.  During play, one of the teams commits a penalty. During the ensuing delayed penalty, the non-offending team scores a goal.  Scoring the goal thus negates the power play that would have resulted.  Easy enough, yes?  

Here's where the debate started:

Say one of the teams is shorthanded 5v4.  While they are shorthanded, the team on the PP commits a penalty and the team that is shorthanded scores a goal on the delayed penalty.  Now... what is the result of this play?  Does the scoring the goal negate the delayed penalty, thus keeping the shorthanded team shorthanded?  Or because the team was shorthanded when they scored, is this a special case where the penalty would not be negated, and the player would still have to serve the penalty?

Any rules experts know the answer to this one?  I recall we tried to look it up, but couldn't find any satisfactory answers, which leads me to believe its the first scenario where the team would continue to be shorthanded but one goal richer, while other folks seemed to think it was the second scenario where they still get 4v4 play even after scoring the goal.

Any info is appreciated.

Edit: most upvoted comments say there is no special case in this situation.  The delayed penalty is still negated as it normally otherwise would be and the teams go back to 5v4 with the shorthanded team up one goal, which is kind what I figured.

9,Am I the only one who feels like the NHL has gotten increasingly boring to watch post-90's era?,"Between the advancement in technology and the skill that has excelled over the last couple of decades, plus the changing of rules to the game, I feel like the NHL has lost a lot of it's luster as having once been the most exciting sport to watch, like it was back in the 90's. The stakes don't seem as high and the obstacles don't seem as challenging for the players of today compared to the players of the 90's. NHL players today make it look easy to the point of making it boring for the viewer. Rarely do you see the amazing slapshot goals that Mcinnis and Hull were known for, rarely do you see the amazing dekes Bure and Sakic were known for, rarely do you see the amazing glove saves and ""robs"" (a term you don't hear much anymore) Roy and Hasek were known for, rarely do you see the bench brawls that would go on for a good ten minutes. Even the commentating today sucks compared to the 90's. 

I also feel like the players themselves had more character than NHL players do now. They were eccentric and cool. They instantly elicited reverence. They knew how to promote themselves. The only player I can think of like that today is Ovechkin. 

I don't want to be one of those lame nostalgic ""Back in my day sonny..."" people, but it just seems like the game is a lot more predictable these days.

54,Help ElChig pick an NHL team!,"G'day all,

I am from Australia, I have been enjoying the Ice Hockey World cup stuff, and was interested in picking a team to cheer on in the 2016 season. I have never watched a game, or even know who previous champions are. I chose the Hartford Whalers as a kid, and obviously they disappeared.

I am not interested in bandwagoning a team that's just won, I don't mind how bad the team is, in fact I'd love to watch the team grow, as it helps you understand a game more.

Factors that may help me pick a team:
In Aussie Rules (AFL) I support the Essendon Bombers.
In the NFL, I am a Browns fan, as you can see, pain doesn't bother me.
Basketball, I am a Spurs fan, the one team I ever picked well when I was a kid.
Baseball, I am an Indians fan, finally on the way up. Everton in the EPL.

Reasons I like the idea of some teams:

I love an underdog story, at the moment in the Australian Rules Football, a team called the Western Bulldogs has just made the Grand Final (the championship game) and they haven't won a Grand Final since 1954, Australia is going nuts about it.

Philadelphia Flyers: The Always Sunny in Philadelphia episode, where Mac and Charlie win the chance to sink a goal at a game.
Boston Bruins: Happy Gilmore, plus when I used to play NHL 97, I used to play these guys all the time, can't remember why.
Anaheim Ducks: The Mighty Ducks movies, loved them as a kid, I know, lame.
Minnesota Wild: Cool colour scheme.
Vancouver Canucks: Like their logo and colours, my stats teacher is from Canada, and is a big fan. Same colours as the Whalers had.

Are there any Australians that play/have played in the NHL? That could help me decide.

Thanks for the help guys, I look forward for your reasons as to why I should choose a team.

71,Alternate Playoff Seeding Proposal,"I was thinking the other day it would be awesome if the playoffs were seeded such that the top seed picked who they would play in the round, the second seed would pick from whomever is left, and so forth. 

Benefits:
-Too often a low seed team is a team that high seeded teams don't actually want to play either because they might be hot going into the playoffs, or they might not match up well. This provides more of a material benefit to being a high seed. Also, allows the high seed to consider things such as geography in making their selection. 
-So much drama! Great underdog stories. 
-So much to talk about for commentators and fans in the lead up to the selection.


Cons:
-Not really sure. You can't have a fixed bracket, but the NHL had reseeding up to a few years ago anyway and so they've dealt with this in terms of scheduling.

113,Who has had a better career to date: Henrik Lundqvist or Carey Price?,"First off I'm a NYR fan. I'm biased. At a local bar I got talking with a guy about hockey and somehow ended up comparing Price vs. Lundqvist. I agreed that Price is the better goalie right now and may end up with the better career, but I argued that King Henrik's career to date makes it a no brainer to pick him in this particular instance. Not a single person there agreed with though and they all thought it was Price by a mile. I'm interested to see what other people's (non montreal or new york fans) opinions are.

Some background stats:

**Carey Price career:**

447 GP

2.43 gaa

.920 sv%

.929 even strength sv%

2.62 playoff gaa

.912 playoff sv%

Best season: 44 wins, 1.96 gaa, .933 sv% 

Awards: 4x All Star, 1 Hart (1 nomination), 1 Ted Lindsay (1 nomination), 1 Vezina (1 nomination), 1 Jennings.
2014 Olympic Gold and Best Goalie, 2016 World Cup of Hockey Gold
 

**Henrik Lundqvist career:**

685 GP

2.28 gaa

.921 sv%

.929 even strength sv%

2.28 playoff gaa

.921 playoff sv%

Best season: 39 wins, 1.97 gaa, .930 sv%

Awards: 3X All-star, 1 Vezina (5 nominations), (1 Hart and 1 Ted Lindsey nomination)
2006 Olympic Gold, 2014 Olympic Silver

Only goalie in NHL history to have 30 wins in each of first 7 seasons (has had it every season aside from the lockout) and first goalie to start career with 11 straight 20 win seasons. 


For me it can all be summed up with Henrik finishing no lower than 6th in Vezina voting in 10 of his 11 seasons (not 2015-2016) whereas Carey Price has only been top 6 three times in his 9 seasons.

I want a team that is exciting to watch, preferably with a focus on offense before defense or goaltending. I would also prefer a team with a little bit of history (preferably a Stanley Cup win) but I am also open to expansion/newer franchises on the up and coming. 
I am also from Ontario (Canada), so although I am open to Western Conference teams, it would make it a little bit more difficult to watch the games.

I am from Australia and been an NHL fan for some 5 years now the question I simply want to ask people who ill know is will teams that obsess with hugging the cap floor always be kinda bad?

I've just recently read about the Datsyuk trade and I am still staggered lol. Coyotes got Datsyuk...they must be serious about performing this year they might be able to put a run together...

Then I find out they traded him, knowing he won't play to pay money to play in Russia to reach the 'cap floor'

I feel even a 'cheap' or cap hugging team does 'somehow' perform miraculously the roster added between half a million and million each to what they are worth each year so hence the players desert the cap floor hugging team in the future, since a cheap team will never pay.

18,Metro Division Predictions,"8). Carolina (72 Pts)
Carolina is in full rebuild mode, the problem is the team doesn't have any superstars up front. This team needs to play badly this year so they can finally draft a forward they can build their team around. They have done a great job building up their defense but now its time to focus up front. 

7). New Jersey (84 Pts)
The acquisition of Hall helps them up front but unfortunately moving Larsson leaves a gaping hole on the back end. The bigger issue is they replaced the loss of Larsson with Lovejoy. Last year the team finished dead is goals scored and Hall alone isn't going to take this team from lowest scoring team in the to a playoff team.

6). Columbus (85 Pts)
As much as I like Brandon Dubinsky as a player, I think he's a great 3rd line center. Problem is, in Columbus he's their number 1 center. Wennberg is someone to get excited about is he ready to step up and be the teams number 1 center? Is he ready to line up against players like Crosby, Stamkos, Tavares and then go up against the other teams top shut down defenseman. I'm doubtful but maybe. Give it a couple years and I think he can become a Nicklas Backstrom caliber player. 

5). New York Islanders (96 Pts)
This maybe one of my more controversial picks and I get it, one there is obviously bias. Two, the Islanders are still treated like the team from the Milbury years. Okposo is gone but Ladd can certainly fill that hole, I'm actually excited to see what he can do with a super star center next to him. The team has decided that its time for the young players of Lee, Nelson, Strome and Cizikas to step up. I believe they can do it and thats why I think the Islanders will take the 8th and final wild card slot. 

4). Philadelphia (97 Pts)
Ghost was the biggest of the year last year. Should have won the Calder trophy but I'm not going to get into that. I do wonder if he's a 1 hit wonder, I certainly hope not. He is fun player to watch and I would like to see him become an elite defenseman. It took Philly awhile but they're starting to shed their older/slower players. Two things are holding this team back, 1 is goalies. Who's going to be the starter? For long stretches Neuvirth looked stronger last year but is he capable of being a number 1 guy? The other is they need a better 2nd line center. Couturier hasn't developed the way Philly hoped. He is a great shut down guy but they need a 2nd line center who can help out more with secondary scoring. 

3). New York Rangers (100 Pts) 
McDonaugh maybe the most underrated super star defenseman in the league. He is so underappreciated by the media and non Ranger fans. I expect to see Girardi and Staal to take on a lesser role this year and to see youngster Skjei to step up and become a top 4 d-man for the team. The big thing about the Rangers is Nash. This is the most important season of his career. He needs to bounce back and get at least 25 goals this year (which I think he's capable). If he doesn't bounce back then its going to have to be Kreider and Miller stepping up again. The Rangers won the Vessey sweep stakes but I'm not convinced. I need to see how he adapts to playing against men.

2) Penguins (101 Pts)
For me Matt Murray wasn't that big of a surprise, I have seen him dominate the AHL for the last 2 years. I was very impressed with the way he handled the pressure of being a starter in the playoffs. I'm wondering how he is going to do this year but I'm fairly certain that he will be just fine. I'm still not crazy about this teams defense but in the playoffs they proved they were good enough. 

1). Washington Capitals (115 Pts)
The Caps are a great team with basically no weaknesses. I like their additions of Winnik and Eller, those 2 should quietly help the team. They have a top goalie, great top 4 d-pairing and the most dangerous forward group in the league. The reason why I think they're going to only have 115 points this year is because last year was a perfect season (at least in the regular season). Everything just seemed to go right for them and they never had a stretch of bad games. I expect them to hit a little adversity this year.",nhl,1472223583,Matt_Landers,3,1,True,2016-08-26

Personally, I hate it.

I think it forces teams to pick up players who are barely good enough to play in the NHL in order to keep the players actually worth their salary.

It also prevents ""all-star"" teams from forming (think the 90s Wings with Yzerman, Shanahan, McCarty, Lidstrom, Osgood, etc).

In addition it creates boring games when you see players who are barely NHL level playing against each other. This is just me, but I want to see the best of the best play against each other, not whoever was good enough to make a low-price contract.

137,[Serious]Please help me with a quick survey for my ongoing sports app development,"Imagine, you are watching a sports event in the stadium.......... Tswap® is designed to create a platform for live game viewers to have the option to exchange seats, so that YOU can enjoy the same game from different angles of the stadium.
What is the advantage? you ask.
You sure want to be seating closer to your favorite team when they are on their attacking side, where all exciting stuff happens, but what happens when they switch sides after halftime? With Tswap®, you will be enjoying the game closer to your team during the entire game. Sometimes, you are simply just bored watching the game from the same angle, but your seating is set for the whole game, Tswap® is here to change that so you can enjoy the game from different areas of the stadium. What if you see a better seat opens up? Did someone leave? or they went out for a drink? Tswap® will help you locate better seats with a discounted rate........
Let us know what you think of this idea, and our team will work hard to make this happen.....

210,Overseas fans: Discussion of what the options (pay/legit or other) there are to watch live games online this season?,"I an an overseas fan and prefer the Canadian broadcasts and intermission shows but this post should not just be about that. Here are 3 options I can think of for any fan living outside of N. America. Are there any more? What other options do we have (Canadian or not). 

1. NHL TV - This looks to be the best option and is relatively inexpensive at $139 for the season and playoffs. My only issue with NHL TV (or NHL GCL as it used to be) is that they used to show a blank screen when the (Canadian) broadcast goes to commercials. In addition they show the same blank screen for the Canadian TV intermissions. Believe it or not, I would prefer to watch the commercials and I definitely want to listen to Hockey Night in Canada intermission show. Im not sure if the new changes with NHL TV (USA) and Rogers GCL (Canada) will change the policy with commercials and intermission show. You can access NHL TV from any IP however they do have a blackout policy which may be worth checking if NHL games are regularly broadcast where you live on other channels.

2. Rogers Gamecenter Live: This is basically NHL TV but the NHL sold off the rights to the broadcast to Rogers (Canada). After chatting with someone from Rogers I was told that there is nothing to stop me from signing up for the service but that I would need to use a Canadian IP to access their broadcast. A proxy can solve this but there can be slow proxy servers. The ""earlybird pass"" is $179 (CAD). Im assuming all the commercials and the intermission shows will be broadcast.  

3. Personal streams online (including youtube): over the years this method has become much more reliable and with HD streams too. The negatives are that ultimately it is not 100% guaranteed and often requires stream refresh, or the stream gets closed down which means you need to search for another one. While there are HD streams, a lot of them are not. When using this method to watch games it is advisable to scan and clean your hd afterwards for spyware and cookies etc. 

Are there any other options out there pay service or otherwise?

The NFL is considering narrowing the field goals posts because kickers are becoming too good to the point of fundementally changing how the game is played. Why can't the NHL see that by keeping the nets the same size while goalies become bigger and faster is causing the game to change for the worse.

Eventually it has to happen. People are are not getting smaller. What happens 20 years from now when most goalies are 7 feet tall, 300 pounds and athletic.

Why wait. Inreset in the NHL is diminishing. Every act the NHL makes to up goal scoring is artificial and pointless. Even if you get more goals there still going to mostly be screen, tips or rebounds. None of which are all that enthralling to watch.

279,Road Rash+Blitz\RollerHockeyBeerLeague= A game that MUST be made soon! I want NO royalties.,"I know sports-loving video gamers have noticed a SEVERE decline in the intensity of their sports games. Sure, EA and Ignite are great, great, unrivaled developers and make unbelievable games. No one will ever beat them at THEIR game.
But... Just but... I believe there are MANY games to be played...
Imagine a non-PRO affiliated sports game (they used to exist!) that is comical, violent, and fast like Road Rash, NFL Blitz, NBA Jam etc... I present (ahem...) The Inline Roller Hockey Beer League. The league would be filled with a bunch of over-weight dad's who drink before the game and maybe even have a keg on the bench. The players profile, or amateur playing card, show their day job, favorite food, beer, and something unique. With some clever writers and illustrators, this could be an absolutely hilarious game, kinda how Road Rash was.
There are made up team names, maybe even sponsored by ridiculous places (i.e. Chico's Bail Bonds) and there are only ever a handful of people watching the game. Any one who's played in a beer league know it's only a wife or two that show up. Even during the championship game, maybe at most, 20? people. It could be pretty funny.
But this game is needlessly violent too. Nasty cheap shots. Endless trash talking that gets worse as the game progresses. The violence would be comically intense with funny animations of guys having to be sent away in stretchers or ambulances or something like that.
The reason sports video games cannot have that is because the NHL has been under heavy scrutiny for violence and, naturally, have barred the glass-shattering hits from their EA video games. But fu@k that!
I know you all can see what I see. A future with a stupid Weekend Beer League video game with violence, bee, glass shattering hits, trash talking, humor, roller hockey, beer, beer, weekend warriors, has-been's, never-were's, beer, washups, liquor then beer, and pure unabashed creativity to make the greatest sports game of the last twenty years.
Let's get this game made and I'll see you in online multiplayer.

Looking for suggestions on cities that would be fairly affordable, descent hockey/arena, and with stuff to do outside of the game. For I would like to do a Rangers game or Blackhawk games but both those tickets are fairly expensive and the cities themselves are costly.


Conclusion: 
Many great suggestions and opinions on where to go see games. Unfortunately right now I can't buy single game tickets or find ticket prices but unless prices are ridiculous I believe my best best for a single game and city experience would be Nashville. Other option I am going to consider is doing a driving road trip to California and trip to hit up a Oilers road swing out there and catch a couple games.

In my opinion his role in the league is to injure players and thats it. I dont want this to be a standard shit post without evidence. So here is why I think he is one of the dirtiest players in the league. 



Video 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KKGq8Zo-TE

I know the NHL issued a statement saying why they think its a legal hit but in my opinion its charging 100%. You don't go speed into the offensive zone like unless you're trying to hurt someone. He wasn't even concerned about the puck, his focus hitting someone at full speed. Not to mention, blind side hit. 

Video 2 https://youtu.be/R-7fUE5H81k 

He sees numbers the whole way and the idiot sitll slams MacDonald in the back. 

Video 3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbuDKQJX05E

Once again, ""hey he's not looking free chance to injure someone better than me.""

Video 4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLmX92SUuiM

I cant tell if he's retarded or if he has learned that he do what ever he wants without being suspended. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2G2uVgO2ps 

Sticks leg out and then looks at the ref to see if he was caught. Guess what, still no suspension. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMlmygY7MbA

Clearly goes for the head. I mean, there is one reason to throw out an elbow like that. To concuss someone. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcZy81gj3mI

I still don't understand how this isn't and targeting the head. Just because you're taller than a player doesn't mean you can target a players head. It means you have to be more creative in making physical while trying to avoid the head. 

I feel like if he played for the Bruins/Flyers he would have been suspended at least 5 times but for what ever reason the NHL seems to be pro Caps and concussions. ",nhl,1471632271,Matt_Landers,4,0,True,2016-08-19

203,32nd team will be Houston or Kansas City,"Once Las Vegas has their team I'm place, they will be looking to place a team in the Central Division. Houston will likely be the NHL's 1st Choice,  but I  understand it may be difficult to get into their building. They would be a great rival for the Dallas Stars and grow the sport in Texas. The other option is to find an owner and place a team in Kansas City, which may be the more likely option. And the NHL likes the Sprint Center, so it may not come as a surprise if the 32nd winds up there. A lot of people say that KC is not a hockey market. Everyone seems to forget that the NHL expanded or placed franchises in a lot of current non traditional markets, case in point, Phoenix, Nashville,  Dallas,  Tampa,  Miami, Anaheim, Carolina, Columbus and Atlanta, which is now Winnipeg. If the NHL is open to going to Las Vegas and these other Places?  Why can't they go to Kansas City? Or relocate franchises to cities that deserve or will support them like Quebec? Seattle would also be a great relocation option if say Phoenix/Arizona fails but I  understand they may try to get an arena built in Scottsdale, which they should have done in the first place. But I  see a KC Franchise happening because Detroit and Columbus are definitely not interested in returning to the West. And someone who loves the NHL,  is rich and will place a franchise there will happen. Another Bill Foley type of guy for KC. And who says that the owner has to from KC to own a franchise there?

239,NHL 16-17 Atlantic Division Predictions,"8). Toronto Maple Leafs (70 PTS)
* Sure they added Matthews and he surely have an impact on the team but he's only one player. He'll probably pitch in and score 25 goals but to me that doesn't much. 
* They added Matt Martin to the line up, I don't really see how his additional 5-10 goals is going to make a huge impact. 
* Nylander Looks like he is going to be a good young player but wouldn't expect more than 15 goals from him. 
* The biggest question for the team this year is goaltending. How is Andersen going to handle being the starter for a bad team? I fully expect him to have the statistical year of his career. 
Toronto is taking the right steps but rebuilds take time and they finally have a young player to build their team around. 

7). Detroit (81 PTS): 
All good streaks come to an end and I just don't think Detroit can keep it up anymore. 
* Nielsen will no longer be playing with Super Star Tavares and will surely see a decrease in offensive production. Zetterberg is showing his age, as is Kronwall. Not to mention they lost Datsyuk. 
* Larkin should continue to improve this year but other than him, this team is either way too average or ageing. 

6). Boston (82 Pts)
* The addition of Backes makes it so the Bruins might have the deepest core up the middle which will make them a better team up front. 
* The problem is, minus Marchand. There isn't much to get excited about when you look the wingers. 
* The bigger problem is that the Bruins didn't fix their defense. They definitely have the slowest d-core in the league. 
* This is going to be another rough year in Boston.

5). Ottawa (85 Pts)
* They will be one of the highest scoring teams in the league, unfortunately they will be among the league leaders in goals allowed as well. 
* Looking at this team they have 7 guys that easily put up 20 goals this year which will make them a dangerous team that can and will score by committee. 
* I don't like this teams goaltending, Anderson is showing his age and Hammond is overrated. 
* I expect a full year with Phaneuf will help the team some but I wouldn't rely on him too much. He's not a very smart defenseman. 

4). Buffalo (90 PTS)
* The team is s close to making the playoffs. They made the right moves this offseason and you have to imagine that their youth will be improving. The problem is, there are still good teams ahead of them. 
* I fully expect Eichel to be a 30 goal scorer this year and Reinhart will surely kick around 25. 
* I like the addition of Kulikov and Ristolainen will continue to develop into an even stronger d-man. 
* The big question for this team is Okposo. How much of an impact will he make? I'm wouldn't be surprised if we saw a dip in his offensive production. Although Eichel is a good player, he is not at the level of John Tavares yet and not having Tavares could hurt his numbers offensively. 
* I won't be surprised if this team does make the playoffs but my prediction is they're going to be very close but sitting just on the outside. 

3). Montreal (101 Pts)
* This may be the most improved team in the league and why is that? A healthy Price. He is the difference between this team making the playoffs and missing. 
* Radulov should help some offensively but I wouldn't expect more 20 goals this year. I wouldn't be surprised if he only ends up with 15. 
* One thing that may hurt this team is Radulov, what kind of presence is he going to have in the locker room? He could end up being a distraction off the ice and mixed in with his lack of effort on the ice could end up hurting this team. 
* The addition of Shaw should help too, he brings a winning attitude and nasty streak. He will certainly make the Habs more annoying to play. 
* Lastly Shea Weber, how much of an impact the trade will have on the future of the franchise is unknown. I believe this year though, the Habs have them selves a better all around defenseman. He's slowing down some but he is still a defenseman that can control the tempo of a game. 

2). Florida Panthers (107 Pts)
* I love everything Florida has done this year (minus trading Kulikov). 
* Bringing in Yandle makes them more dangerous on the backend. Also Matheson should be NHL ready so he'll bring even more mobility to this already very mobile defense. Signing Demers just makes their top 4 d-core that much better and Ekblad is going to keep developing into a Norris trophy contender. 
* Up front the team didn't make many changes but they didn't have to. 
* The team had a very disappointing end to the season but they learned what its going to take to win a playoff series. Florida fans will probably blame the refs but if you ask the Panters players, they lost the series because they couldn't hold leads late in games and they weren't hungry enough in over time. Going 0-3 in overtime is not a recipe for success. 
* Florida will win their first playoff series in 20 years this year. 

1). Tampa Bay (109 Pts)
* The team just seemed off for one reason or another last year. The team will be back on track and looking to make another push to Stanley Cup finals. 
* This almost perfect team. They have depth at all positions. They have a super star forward who can carry them up front, they have a top defenseman in the league that controls the game and a goalie who stops the puck. 
* I expect a bounce back year from Johnson and the entire team. 
* This is my team to make the Stanely Cup finals out of the east.

17,Rating Every NHL Team #6: Winnipeg Jets,"So it's been almost a whole week since my last post.  I'm sorry but I've been really busy between work, summer class, and traveling that I haven't had a free night in a while.  My last article was the biggest success yet which made me really happy.  I also was told that I could do a better job formatting so, were going to try that for today's article on the Winnipeg Jets.  This is a tough one, because they have had two franchises who were named the Jets, but were two different teams.  I'm going to stick with the former Atlanta Thrashers because this is my post and I get to make this decision.

 

**Past**
The franchise began as the Atlanta Thrashers which was a much better name than the flames.  The Thrashers were not anything special other than Kovalchuk who they traded to New Jersey for Johnny Oduya and a few prospects that are irrelevant now.  They were a forgettable franchise that didn't win a single playoff game in their one appearance.  They had Andrew Ladd and Dustin Byfuglien for a year before they moved to Winnipeg.  The fans loved their ""new"" team instantly and season tickets sold out within 17 minutes.  In Winnipeg, they built a solid team around Byfuglien and Ladd which made the playoffs in 2015 due to the absence of two of the California teams.  Unfortunately for them, the Ducks made it to the playoffs and swept the Jets candidly.  Overall, they're a young franchise who has shown glimpses of hope and benefits from being in one of the strongest markets in the league.  2/10

 

**Present**
In some ways they're a lot like the Calgary Flames.  They both took advantage of L.A. and San Jose missing the playoffs in 2015, managed to squeak into a wildcard spot making the franchise's second appearance.  They still failed to get the first postseason win in franchise history which was sad, however the younger team showed optimism.  This past season they struggled and were out of the race pretty quickly.  The best part of their season was undoubtedly the emergence of Mark Scheifele.  After Brian Little's season ended early due to injury, Scheifele absolutely tore it up.  He was almost a point per game player over the whole season, and with Wheeler and Ehlers showed he can be a bonafide, first-line center.  Little went down on Feb. 18 and since then, Scheifele had 34 points in 26 games (including the one where Little got hurt).  Beyond their new found beast, they have Wheeler coming off a career year, and the leagues heaviest player and biggest hitter, Dustin Byfuglien.  Byfuglien is interesting because he is not just a physical, shutdown defenseman.  He also brings a great shot, and the ability to quarterback a solid powerplay unit.  They were let down by the step backwards taken by Jacob Trouba, and the fact that their depth players were not great.  At goaltender, they have a solid young player in Connor Hellebuyck, but sent him down to avoid waiving another goalie, and possibly to help them improve their lottery odds.  Hellebuyck is their best goalie for sure and he only just turned 23.  Overall, they have a solid core, but need to see progress from their youth and depth players if they want to contend for a playoff spot in the brutal central division.  5/10

 

**Future**
Their future is their bright spot.  Winnipeg has several top quality prospects headlined by recently drafted Patrik Laine.  In goal they have the aforementioned Hellebuyck along with Eric Comrie.  They have one of the best NCAA prospects in Kyle Connor who can play center or on the wing.  Connor averaged almost perfectly a goal and an assist per game and finished the season on a ridiculous point streak.  On top of them, Josh Morrissey projects to be a top four defenseman and a ton of other prospects who look like they can be solid NHL players.  It seems like only a matter of time before they can package a few of them for a top four defenseman and become a contender.  Next year, I think Ehlers-Scheifele-Laine (Maybe we see Wheeler or Laine forced to LW?) will be a feared line.  If they stay healthy, it wouldn't be surprising to see them all as >1 point per game players.  Overall, it is really hard to deny that they will be a great team soon.  They have a championship core and now its time to build around it.  9/10

 

**Bottom Line**
Winnipeg gets a 16/30 which is a little below average and clearly due to their bad history.  They project to be a major threat in the central division a few years down the road.  They have two of the best forward prospects in the entire NHL along with one of the next best centers.  They have a few players in their prime and a good, young goalie.  They have what it takes to be good, and I think they're a solid pick to be a dark horse next year in the central.  I know it's frowned upon to talk about a player before he's touched the ice for an NHL game, but the addition of Laine and Connor looks to threaten Dallas for the most prolific offense.  A top six of Ehlers, Scheifele, Laine, Wheeler, Little, and Connor looks like it really could.  Mix in Byfuglien and their powerplay looks dangerous.  Their history isn't great, but they appear to have the beginnings of greatness in the palms of their hands. ",nhl,1466998789,TSN_Hopeful,21,30,True,2016-06-26

21,Why don't hockey players just play for their favorite teams?,"As someone who doesn't follow hockey that much, I always wondered about the following: Why don't hockey players play for their favorite teams?

Let me give you an example. Sidney Crosby's favorite hockey team is the Montreal Canadiens. He, like many other Canadians, grew up cheering and rooting for them.

However, he was drafted by Pittsburgh upon entering the NHL and has stayed there since. Why does he continue to play for Pittsburgh and not just voluntarily play for the Canadiens? At this point in his career (or whenever his contract is up), can't he just call up the GM of the Canadiens and say, ""Hey, I would like to play for you guys!"" 

Certainly he's already made his name in the annals of hockey history, and has more money than he could ever spend. Why, then, doesn't he just choose to play for his favorite childhood team—a Canadian one after all? He only ended up on the Penguins because they, as a matter of circumstance, had first draft pick several seasons ago; it is not like he chose to go to the Penguins because that's the jersey he wanted to wear, right?

Thanks.

**EDIT:** Didn't Lebron James do something like this where he went back to his hometown team, even though they weren't as good as his previous team and wouldn't be able to pay him as much?!

33,"Ten 2016 season, ""the most valuable"" non-quarterback player","Fans of the 21st century may be very surprised, before the quarterback is not always at the top of NFL salary structure. Such as the late 1970s, the highest league salary is two future Hall of Fame running back: OJ- Simpson and Walter - Payton.
About 40 years later, the cycle of an initial prototype. Shinco Super Bowl MVP von - Miller to ask Broncos defensive alliance group first big contract, Eagles defensive end Darren Fletcher - Cox's new contract makes him the second most expensive in the history of the NFL quarterback non-players.
For this reason, 2016 before the start of the season, let's look at the league's top ten ""most valuable"" non-quarterback player.
1. JJ- Watt, defensive end, Houston Texans


Over the past four years, won three Defensive Player of the Year, JJ- Watt in his Language of age is a dominant game Terminator. Watts, 27, and Lawrence has - Taylor, Reggie - White par become one desperate defensive player in history most people.
This is not the first time nor the last time we guess he's worth much higher than the team's starting quarterback.
2. Rob - glycopyrrolate Koski, tight end, New England Patriots


Watt defense group, the offensive group of glycopyrrolate Koski. Glycopyrrolate Koski body is so terror, that many NFL experts said he was ""laboratory products"" or ""football God's masterpiece."" Barrier glycopyrrolate Koski is almost impossible, you may need to do some synthesized in the laboratory, such as Jamie - Collins size and athleticism, Richard - Sherman key ball ability and Patrick - Pete Sen's speed and flexibility.
This offseason, Cardinals general manager Steve - Keyi Mu said the league is now not a complete tight end. Everett is now not only can not stop the ball pseudo offensive linemen, that does not stop the large wide receiver. Glycopyrrolate Koski is not the only exception is the history of blocking the ball the best combination of players.
3. Aaron - Donald, defensive tackle, Los Angeles Rams


Donald started from a standstill and his super-explosive defensive tackle common distinction between open. The advantages of flexibility and agility coupled with his strong hands, always keep the pace moving, top predators murderous chase speed and flawless body.
 ""Extremely, extremely destructive,"" Pirates coach Dirk - Cottle says the end of last season. ""Our scout team spent several weeks to study the opponent, they told me Donald and JJ- Watt is the same level of players. It's incredible to me, and when I saw the video game when I realized watt and he really is a level! I mean, last season for him is brilliant, he is definitely a game Terminator. ""
4. Von - Miller, linebacker, Denver Broncos


Can single-handedly reverse the man of the match, Von - Miller is the biggest reason the Broncos last season, rather than the other team won the Super Bowl. When the offensive tackles doing all the super side catch red setter, Miller is always a turn to get rid of opponents, this is his last season 16th oppression quarterback sources. It is foreseeable that Miller's next contract will make him the highest-paid non-quarterback NFL players.
5. Luke - Jike Li, linebacker, Carolina Panthers


Panthers linebacker to rely more than any team league, and Luke - Jike Li linebacker group is the core power. Terror has athleticism and ability to read the game quickly, he faced the road offensive to recover the body and speed control range when face air strikes are the last fifty years in the top linebacker. Without von - Miller Super Bowl performance, we discuss how the rule should be Jike Li playoffs.
6. Antonio - Brown, wide receiver, Pittsburgh Steelers


- Chris Harris is one of the NFL's top cornerback, Consecutive Pro Bowl two seasons. However, last December, will be the world's football wide receiver ran the route he tortured a whole, 13 catches for 147 yards to win plus two touchdowns, all singled Harris.
 ""This is the best and the best matchup, and he won,"" Harris admits. ""I have not lost a game two touchdowns ...... he played well. He is currently the league's best wide receiver.""
7. Julio - Jones, wide receiver, Atlanta Falcons


If Antonio - Brown dominated the first active NFL external throne, then Julio - Jones infinitely close to him. Jones is clearly both in stature and more of a threat. 2015 season, his ball a few yards and receptions are the second highest in league history.
Ever since entering the league in 2011, both the strength and speed of Julio - Jones is the core of the Falcons offensive group, he is definitely more than the main team quarterback Matt - Ryan also indispensable.
8. Odell - David Beckham, wide receiver, New York Giants


Brown and Jones should enjoy the moment the thrill of standing proudly top of the league because the league's most talented wide receiver is looming. On the output of the previous two seasons of his career, since ancient times, and nobody can Odell - compared to David Beckham. After the 2015 season, the fifth week of the season's first show, Beckham scored 25 touchdowns, the same period the number of the closest alliance touchdowns Beckham is glycopyrrolate Koski, but also worse 5.
In the end is what makes Odell - Beckham so extraordinary? Simple list what: Portrait of explosive, incredible jumping and endurance, a steady stream of creativity, the ability to self-adjust the air, the rare ability to stop Taiwan stay, easily throw off the defensive player of the ability to understand and become familiar with all the wide receiver position and running route, the top of the ball and feel the world-class athleticism.
9. Khalil - Mark, linebacker / defensive end, Oakland Raiders


Mark has been able to threaten Frederick - Miller Union's number one side red setter throne, but 2015 just his second season. Last season Mark created a history. He became the NFL history as the first two positions (linebacker / defensive end) players selected for the Team of the Year. After the 2015 season saw Mark last six 10 sack crazy performance, Derek - Carl confident Mark can break - Michael Strachan held the single-season sack record number.
""I think he can take a 30 sack season,"" says Carl recent interview. ""Look at the video game you can see, he took control of every file attack. League no one like him, he was a genius.""
10. Patrick - Peterson, cornerback, Arizona Cardinals


For a long time, Peterson is considered the most gifted NFL defensive backs. But before last season, many people think that stable Peterson was selected to the Pro Bowl because of his reputation as a state rather than a season. After last season's successful weight loss and diabetes control the disease, in the 2015 season, Peterson finally show the quality of the top cornerback. As the undisputed most NFL cornerback silence, when Peterson played each other only a 45.6 quarterback rating, with an average 18.9 profile attack before allowing opponents to complete a pass, two data led coalition cornerback.http://wholesalejerseysstore.ru

51,Giants quarterback Eli - Manning: looking back to the playoffs,"New York Giants in the last four years, did not enter the playoffs, which is since the 1964 to 1980 season, 17 playoff potential energy dismal time longest time playoff drought. Last season's disappointing record of 6 wins and 10 losses led to coach - Tom Coughlin (Tom Coughlin) and class at this year's offseason team generous investment in the free agent market.
Although the Giants made a lot of changes in the offseason to try to re-energized, quarterback Eli - Manning (Eli Manning) has been considered a continuation of some of the elements of the past can help the team out of trouble.
""I am very excited about this year's Giants, I respect the coach (Ben -) McAdoo (Ben McAdoo) and stay in the same group of offensive excited,"" Manning expressed NFL official website. ""I look forward to return to the playoffs and are expected to return to our state.""
Before McAdoo took over the Giants offensive coordinator in 2014, the Giants offensive team just had a dismal season, averaging only 18.5 points achieved, which ranked fifth in the league. In the first year McAdoo coaching, this figure increased by 23.8 points to the scene. Giants last season, averaging 26.3 points achieved, ranked sixth in the NFL.
McAdoo usher now as the Giants coach's first season, while the team offensive group remained unchanged, Manning McAdoo for the third year coach has greater expectations.
""We expect to get more points. We think we can get, averaging more than 28 points,"" Manning said. ""Last year I think we approached this figure in the third year of this offensive group, with like Stirling - new weapons such (Sheppard) (Sterling Shepard), ushered in Victor - Cruz (Victor Cruz) the return of Larry - Tang Naier (Larry Donnell) back to health .... we have a lot of offensive weapons. ""
Admittedly, the problem is not the offensive team last season. Giants defensive group last season's league opponents get the most yardage and more than a third of the score. However, if the offensive team promoted to another level, any defensive group is difficult to stop them to win a playoff spot.http://wholesalejerseysstore.ru

Last weekend we had a blast with my friends when we played a lot of Fifa and NHL, 2012 editions. The one of the funniest moments in the NHL is when referee has blown the whistle and game 'stops' and after that you have appr. 10 seconds time to beat the goalie (and the other players). Kinda childish, yes, but fun at the later hours.

Our problem is that in newer NHL editions we have seen that when ref blows the whistle the game starts almost immediately a cutscene and we can't give our love to goalie. So I ask you: which is the latest edition of NHL where you can have a 10 second moment when you can tackle goalie or other players?

178,Rating Every NHL Team #7: Arizona Coyotes,"So it's safe to say that I have been a slacker recently and I apologize for that.  One post in a span of about two weeks is pretty bad, but I had a bit of a surprise vacation come up.  I am an American and I took the long weekend off of everything.  I'm back now and I plan on writing four articles in four days, with one being something other than my Rating Every NHL Team series.  Today's team is the Arizona Coyotes.

 

**Past**
The Arizona Coyotes began their life as the original Winnipeg Jets who dominated the WHA during its short-lived life.  This team featured Bobby Hull who missed the legendary Summit Series because he played in the WHA.  I actually have met Bobby Hull, and I must say that he is a very kind man who let me take a picture with one of his Stanley Cup Rings (He won one as a player but was given rings for Chicago's recent cups).  They then merged into the NHL where they were not able to continue their success.  During their awkward transition, they posted a memorable 9 win season which is good for the second worst ever.  Once they got their feet, they were an above average team who struggled to beat the legendary Oilers.  In Winnipeg, they had Keith Tkachuk who was their most memorable player.  They eventually moved to Arizona due to the crash of Canadian teams in the 90's and the fact that they had a bad arena.  (Weird to think Winnipeg fans didn't kill people over this).  In Arizona, their history has been marked by their failures to develop as a hockey market, their impending move as a team, and the career of Shane Doan.  They had a good run in the 2012 playoffs, but nothing else too noteworthy.  They also are known for having legendary (for the wrong reasons) goaltender Ilya Bryzgalov. Overall, their history has a few good players, but isn't anything too special.  **3/10**

 

**Present**
The Arizona Coyotes had a terrible 2014-15 season where their GM literally admitted to tanking.  They were unlucky, however and won a crucial game in Buffalo, which contributed to their finishing in second to last.  Arizona then got bumped out of the top two in the draft by Edmonton, and missed out on either Eichel or McDavid.  They went into the 2015-16 season as favorites to land hometown kid, and hopeful franchise saver, Auston Matthews, but surprised everyone by starting out the season very well.  They defied expectations with the help of the Domi-Hanzal-Duclair line which eventually was not able to carry the load and eventually, the surging Ducks passed Arizona in the standings and resulted in Arizona missing the playoffs.  On top of those three, they have a team legend in Shane Doan who should be in the tail-end of his career, and also have one of the best offensive devensemen in the league in Oliver Ekman-Larsson.  They did not get a chance to draft Matthews, but did however get both Clayton Keller and Jakob Chychrun.  This was thanks to savvy new general manager, John Chayka.  Chayka has been GM for a short period of time, but has shown to be more than capable with his ability to lure in Alex Goligoski after trading for his negotiating rights, and his confidence at the draft table.  He's young for a GM, but he is acting like he is large and in charge.  Chayka comes form a non-traditional background in advanced analytics, and could be the next ""Moneyball"" story bringing success to a low budget team.  I am really intrigued in what he has to offer, and I can't wait to see what his next move is.  Overall, they've had a rather quick turnaround from their recent down period, but still don't look to be too much of a factor in the Pacific, so long as the California teams remain dominant.  **5/10**

 

**Future**
The Coyotes have a young team, and a great cap situation, which factors to be the beginning of a successful franchise.  I think that they have a good core in place, but lack the true #1, Selke-type center that it takes to win in today's NHL.  I think that they will struggle to overtake the California teams, and will be one of many competing for a wildcard spot.  I think that they definitely can build a good team around Ekman-Larsson and Domi, but they will need a better center to build a great team around them.  Hopefully for their sake, either Dylan Strome or Clayton Keller can become that big center required to win in the west.  They also have Nick Merkley who was selected with the 30th overall pick in the loaded 2015 draft.  I think Merkley is going to surprise people because of his sheer speed.  I have seen him play a few time and I was very impressed.  I was shocked to see him drop to 30.  For some reason, I feel like he will develop into a solid second line winger for the Coyotes.  I could even see him playing with Domi and doing very well.  Also in their prospect pool is Louis Domingue who showed flashes of brilliance in the NHL this year during Mike Smith's absence.  Overall, I think that the Coyotes have a shot at a wildcard spot, but I think they are a few years away from being a serious contender.  7/10

 

**Bottom Line**
The Coyotes get a 15/30 which was a lot better than I thought they would do.  Despite this, I stand by my evaluation that they are not actually that bad in the present.  They were especially bad last year in an admitted attempt to finish last place, which is forgiven by their growth this past season.  I think that their future as a team looks good, however it is in question whether or not it will be in the state of Arizona.  I chose not to include this in the future section of the article, because I think that it has little to do with the ability of their players.   I think the Coyotes are in a good position to move forward, and that they need to be careful if they want the Ekman-Larsson era to be fruitful.  ",nhl,1467770663,TSN_Hopeful,1,8,True,2016-07-05

189,A Bold and Meek Prediction for Every NHL Team,"So, as promised, I am going to write an article that isn't part of my ""Rating Every NHL Team"" series.  This post will also be part of my four posts in four days to make up for my lack of writing.  In this article, I plan on putting in writing both a bold, and meek prediction for each team for the upcoming season.  I am also going to consider it ""bold"" to make a very specific prediction because this is my article and I am allowed to do things like that. I can't wait to see which, if any, of these come true.

 

**Anaheim Ducks**
Bold: Ryan Kesler takes a huge step backwards and Ducks fans begin to realize the horror of his contract.
Meek: John Gibson has a breakout year as the Ducks flourish.  They make a strong playoff run.

 

**Arizona Coyotes**
Bold: The Coyotes pad the stats of Martin Hanzal, and Antoine Vermette by playing them in the top six, and then trade him for valuable draft picks at the deadline.  Either a first (if they go together) or two seconds (if they go in separate deals).  
Meek: Louis Domingue takes over and flourishes as the starting goalie after Mike Smith has a rough start to the year. 

 

**Boston Bruins**
Bold: David Pastrnak gets traded for a gritty power forward between now and July 1, 2017.
Meek: Tuukka Rask has an off year, Chara is noticeably too slow, and the Bruins miss the playoffs.

 

**Buffalo Sabres**
Bold: Jack Eichel does not break 65 points, and Sabres fans incorrectly begin to panic that he is not going to become the star that he was expected to be.
Meek: Led by a breakout year from Rasmus Ristolainen, the Sabres fight for a playoff spot, but just barely miss out.  

 

**Calgary Flames**
Bold: The Flames finish with 92+ points but still miss the playoffs.
Meek: Brian Elliot fits in well, Gaudreau and Monahan have great seasons again, and their defense looks a lot more like what it was in 2014-15.

 

**Carolina Hurricanes**
Bold: They show that 2015-2016 was a fluke, and they descend toward the bottom of the standings. 
Meek:  Cam Ward and Eddie Lack end the season with just about the same number of starts, and neither one is all that impressive.

 

**Chicago Blackhawks**
Bold: Ryan Hartman shows that he has the tools to become the next Matt Martin, and is part of a popular fourth line.
Meek: Brian Campbell fits like a glove at first, but slows down as the year goes on.  He doesn't look too good in the playoffs as father time begins catching up to him.

 

**Colorado Avalanche**
Bold: This is the final year for both Joe Sakic and Patrick Roy.
Meek: Jarome Iginla retires after the entire team has a bad year and misses the playoffs again.

 

**Columbus Blue Jackets**
Bold: David Clarkson plays 65+ games and begins to look more like the Clarkson in New Jersey.
Meek:  Ryan Murray becomes the next Adam Larsson, and Columbus trades him for a forward of more value.

 

**Dallas Stars**
Bold: Benn and Seguin can't score enough to make up for the goals let up by their goaltending, but Dallas still makes the playoffs as the 3rd-6th best team in the West.
Meek:  John Klingberg has another stellar season and proves that he is one of the best defensemen in the league for his contract.

 

**Detroit Red Wings**
Bold: The Wings end their streak and finally miss the playoffs.
Meek: Thomas Vanek plays fewer than 30 games for reasons other than injury.

 

**Edmonton Oilers**
Bold: Despite Adam Larsson looking much better than expected, the Oilers still finish bottom five in the league.
Meek: Nail Yakupov is traded for a right-handed defenseman who has an okay season on the second pair.

 

**Florida Panthers**
Bold: They have an incredible regular season but leave the playoffs early and begin a reputation as a team who chokes in the playoffs.
Meek: Tom Rowe is voted GM of the year.

 

**Los Angeles Kings**
Bold: The Kings make some sort of deal with Las Vegas to ensure that Dustin Brown is lost in the expansion draft.
Meek: Despite a great year from Tyler Toffoli, the Kings make the playoffs as a low seed, and do not have a deep run.

 

**Minnesota Wild**
Bold: The Wild do not have a good year at all and fans begin to seriously question whether or not Suter and Parise are a sufficient core.
Meek:  Jonas Brodin is one of the only bright spots in an otherwise dull year for the Wild.

 

**Montreal Canadiens**
Bold: Carey Price is great, but Alexander Radulov is worth every penny of his contract as the Canadiens march confidently into the playoffs.
Meek:  Shea Weber gets plenty of undeserved credit for Price's outstanding comeback season.

 

**Nashville Predators**
Bold: They win the cup over the Tampa Bay Lightning in 6.
Meek: The 2015-16 Penguins excelled in the playoffs because they split up Crosby, Malkin and Kessel.  Nashville forces Josi-Subban for a while, but then decides to use the Penguins' idea on defense and split the two up.

 

**New Jersey Devils**
Bold: The Devils make the playoffs as a wildcard, and upset the Florida Panthers in the first round.
Meek: Taylor Hall has a great season, but the true story in New Jersey revolves around Cory Schneider's ability to steal games and get the Devils into the playoffs.

 

**New York Islanders**
Bold: Ladd proves to be a more than formidable replacement for Okposo, and forms great chemistry with Tavares.
Meek:  Nick Leddy builds off of his great performance in the playoffs and emerges as a #1 defenseman.

 

**New York Rangers**
Bold: Despite Lundqvist's best efforts, they miss the playoffs.
Meek: Marc Staal and Dan Girardi compete with each other to see who can gain the distinction of ""worst contract in hockey"" first.

 

**Ottowa Senators**
Bold: Bobby Ryan has a terrible year, and the Senators finish at or around the bottom 5.
Meek: Their season quickly goes downhill, and Erik Karlsson is given much more freedom with the puck.  He puts up a ridiculous stat line.

 

**Philadelphia Flyers**
Bold: Ivan Porvorov has an outstanding rookie season and is a Calder finalist.
Meek:  Radko Gudas gets at least three suspensions.

 

**Pittsburgh Penguins**
Bold: They play a full season with Fleury and Murray, and make a deep playoff run.
Meek: They have very even scoring, with no apparent first line. 

 

**San Jose Sharks**
Bold: Joe Thornton fires on all cylinders, shows no signs of slowing down, but cannot lead San Jose past Nashville in the playoffs.
Meek: Joonas Donskoi emerges as the next star forward for San Jose.

 

**St. Louis Blues**
Bold: The Blues take after Tampa Bay, chose to remain patient with Shattenkirk, keep him for the whole season, and are eliminated in the second round of the playoffs.
Meek: Colton Parayko takes another step forward and scores 15+ goals. 

 

**Tampa Bay Lightning**
Bold: Nikita Kucherov leads the team in points, and they lose to Nashville in the Stanley Cup Final.
Meek: Ben Bishop gets hurt, and Vasilevskiy shows to Yzerman that he is ready to takeover as the starting goalie. 

 

**Toronto Maple Leafs**
Bold: They finish in the bottom five again, but their next generation of players show good signs of development. 
Meek:  Auston Matthews has absolutely no problem dealing with the ruthless Toronto media.

 

**Vancouver Canucks**
Bold: Alex Burrows says something to someone twice his size and spends half the season on the IR.
Meek: Despite being a bottom five team for the entire season, the Canucks still trade a second round pick for Lee Stempniak to bolster their playoff chances.

 

**Washington Capitals**
Bold: Ovechkin plays the entire season like a man on a mission, and is devastated when they are ousted by the Lightning in the conference final.  
Meek:  John Carlson gives Klingberg a run for his money to be considered as the best elite defenseman with a cheap contract.

 

**Winnipeg Jets**
Bold: Mark Scheifele is a point per game player and begins to be considered as an elite center.
Meek: Patrik Laine wins the Calder.

190,Manning think Miller and wild horse contract is not a problem,"Recently Manning - Payton (Manning Peyton) said he believed that Feng - Miller (Miller Von) and Denver wild horse will break the deadlock completed a long time contract.
He told TMZ reporters: ""I think Miller will re signing, I don't think this is a problem, on both sides of the efforts to this end, I know he wants to stay in Denver, Denver also need him, so I think all the talks properly.""
Miller as a super bowl MVP recent attitude gradually positive, although he had refused to sign the franchise's signature, which is at least $14 million 100 thousand worth of revenue in a single season. At present, we can only hope that everything is determined in July 15, otherwise the future who can not be determined.
Miller had made it clear that he will not participate in the franchise under the new season of the game, he is waiting for the big contract.
It is reported that the new contract offer is 114 million 500 thousand years 6 dollars, Miller seems to be very satisfied with this figure, but for the part of the security is not satisfied.http://wholesalejerseysstore.ru

I used to have a handle on six-hundred-and-some-odd players back when I collected hockey cards and played NHL 94 and had names and stats staring me in the face all the time, but those days are long gone – the names on the back of my team’s jerseys are only vaguely familiar (only three of them were around in 2009), anyone who was drafted third-overall or later since 2008 is a name I probably won’t know, and I was stunned to realize that Sid and Ovie have been in the league long enough that they’ll both probably hit 1000 points this season (this applies to more than just hockey, but was 2005 really *that long ago*?!)

In short, the NHL has moved on without me.

How do I even begin the process of going about familiarizing myself with thirty rosters, and the stats and stories that come with them, after having let that knowledge slowly erode over two decades?

334,What would have happened if Steven Stamkos were to leave Tampa Bay?,"What would have happened if Steven Stamkos were to leave Tampa Bay?

As we all know by now, Steven Stamkos was the speculation of many trade rumors during his final year of his contract, and Stamkos Watch was always one of the top talking points during this past season. Stamkos made Tampa fans rejoice and other potential suitors weep as he resigned with the Bolts for 8yr/$68 million, which is incredibly cheap for a player of his caliber. But what were to happen to the Lightning if Stamkos were to chase the money instead of the stability? Let's see.

There were three potential suitors for Stamkos before he signed: the San Jose Sharks, the Toronto Maple Leafs, and the aforementioned Tampa Bay Lightning. If he would have signed with another team, no matter whether the Maple Leafs or the Sharks took Stamkos, Tampa's lineup would have looked like this:

Forwards
Palat, Kucherov, and Johnson
Drouin, Filppula, and Namestnikov 
Callahan, Boyle, and Brown
Paquette, Killorn, and Conacher

Defensemen 
Hedman-Stralman 
Coburn-Garrison
Koekkoek-Sustr 

Goalies:
Ben Bishop, Andrei Vasilevskiy, and Kristers Gudlevskis

Nikita Kucherov and Victor Hedman become the faces of the franchise, though both of their contracts are strange as well. It's a safe assumption to say that Tampa would have made the playoffs, with Kucherov as a Top-10 NHL player, but would get eliminated in the first or second round by a better team such as the New York Islanders or Pittsburgh Penguins. After that season, they most likely lose Ben Bishop, Victor Hedman, and Jonathan Drouin, effectively ending their playoff hopes for the next few years.   It's a downward spiral effect that a player of Stamkos' caliber has on the rest on the team. Without Stamkos, the Lightning's goal production would have most certainly gone down by a substantial margin. The same is true for the opposite. Since Stamkos stayed and actually gave the Lightning a hometown discount, the trickle down effect also reached the other critical pillar of the franchise, Victor Hedman (8 yr/$64 million) and should happen to RFA Nikita Kucherov as well.

20,Interesting read - Who Are This Year’s NHL Hart Trophy Finalists?,"The NHL has announced the three finalists for the MVP trophy.

Sidney Crosby, a two time winner, finished third in the league with 85 points in 80 games, including a league-high 58 points in 44 games in 2016.

After a slow start to the season, the coaching change to Mike Sullivan sparked the team and rejuvenated the Penguins' star.  If he wins, he'll be just the 9th player to win the award three times, joining the likes of Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux and Alexander Ovechkin.

The only two players to score more points than Crosby were the two players he is in competition with for the award. Fellow Canadian star, Jamie Benn, finished the season second in the league with 89 points in 82 games and scored the third highest goal total with 41. It was the first 40 goal season by a Star since Mike Modano in 1993-1994.

NHL Hart Trophy FinalistsHe captained the Dallas Stars to their first division title since the 2005-2006 season. His Hart trophy finalist nomination is the first in the franchise's history.

The third candidate -- and most likely to win -- is Patrick Kane. Who would've expected the season he had considering the offseason he had just prior. After a sexual assault allegation over the summer, many ""experts"" in the media debated whether or not the Blackhawks should release their star and $10 million man. The specifics of the situation may not be clear, but the bottom line is that the charges were dropped and he was exonerated.

The Hawks did not decide to move their star and they were rewarded handsomely for it. He got off to the hottest NHL Hart Trophy Finalistsstart in recent memory and went on a franchise-record 26-game point streak. It was also the longest such streak in 23 years. He created such a cushion in the scoring race and was able to maintain pace throughout the rest of the year that the winner of the Art Ross Trophy, awarded to the league's top point scorer, was never really in doubt.

Kane finished with 106 points to become the first United States-born player to ever win the award. That's pretty incredible considering the numbers that were put up by players like Modano, Brett Hull, and Jeremy Roenick. He also finished second in the league with 46 goals. This is unknown territory for American-born players and further proof that the United States is catching up in terms of player development.

After a few solid showings at the Olympics, the U.S. will have a chance to battle for some hardware at the upcoming World Cup of Hockey.

49,Is the Tarasenkshow unhappy with the scene in St. Louis?,"During the Western Conference Final, which featured the resilient San Jose Sharks eliminating the ""playoff chokers"" St. Louis Blues in six games, Blues star right winger, Vladimir Tarasenko, was nowhere to be seen until the final period of the last game. 

Tarasenko, 24, has been with the Blues ever since they drafted him 16th overall in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft. He joined the team in the 2012-13 lockout shortened season, and has shown his prescence on the ice ever since. Many see him as the best player on the Blues, which is a large reason as to why the Blues organization awarded him with an eight year, $60 million deal, which carries an AAV of $7.5 million a year. 

No matter what team you root for (even a Chicago fan like myself), you have to see that ""Vova"" is a rare, exceptional talent. One that doesn't come around every year. His extreme puck skills, vast sniping attributes and overall insane hockey IQ make him one of the most valuable players in the league. He was the second best ""Cost per Point"" player in the NHL this year, behind Blackhawks right wing Patrick Kane. 

Even at a high cap hit of $7.5 million per year, roughly 10.5 percent of St. Louis' salary cap, it is apparent that the Blues got him on a cheaper amount than his skills would command for. But is Tarasenko, coming off his best year with the Blues, beginning to want to leave St. Louis?

At the Blues locker room clean up day, many Blues players like Alex Pietrangelo, Kevin Shattenkirk and David Backes all reflected on the Blues best season in years, praising the teams dedication, perseverance and dominance on the ice. But Tarasenko declined to comment with reporters, not even offering any insight on how he felt about the season or his plans for his shortest offseason of his career.

Now, this isn't supposed to be a ""bash Tarasenko for not talking to the media"" type piece. Not at all. Personally, I love it when athletes don't talk to/barely talk to reporters, because if I had just lost a game I wouldn't be too happy either. But still it's worth questioning and discussing the possibility of Vova being unhappy with the Blues.

The Blues were able to eliminate the defending Stanley Cup champions, the Chicago Blackhawks, in the first round, even though it took a grueling seven games. However, numerous times it seemed like Blues head coach Ken Hitchcock was not playing Tarasenko enough, or just not at the right times. Chicago's penalty kill wasn't as strong as years past, even with penalty killing forward Marcus Kruger back. But at some points Tarasenko was not on the ice and expressed his frustration numerous times with his head coach, most notably at the end of the second period in game 6 against Chicago when Tarasenko was visibly unhappy with Hitchcock.

Could his difficult time in the Western Conference Final, his seemingly worsened relationship with Hitchcock and his refusal to talk to reporters at locker room clean up day be a sign that Vova wants to leave St. Louis? Does he want general manager Doug Armstrong and co to shake up the roster to stray away from the Anaheim Duck-like check first style of play to the Pittsburgh Penguin-like speed first style of play? Does he want to become captain of the team to further shape what gets shown on and off the ice from the Blues?

Many questions could be asked about what Vladimir Tarasenko wants from the Blues and what his media refusal means for the incredible player. Only time will tell what happens to the scene in St. Louis.


Feel free to comment, question and discuss this. If you think this article was just an over-exaggeration of a simple act, why? If you think Vladimir Tarasenko wants out of St. Louis (like the Rams did), where do you think is a reasonable landing spot for Vova?",nhl,1464496041,nhlnews72,13,0,True,2016-05-29
56,What should the Lightning do with Steven Stamkos?,"At the beginning of the Stanley Cup playoffs, many people counted out the defending Eastern Conference Champions Tampa Bay Lightning. Without captain Steven Stamkos due to blood clots seemed to be too much for the team to handle.

But with streaky young winger Jonathan Drouin added a pleasant consistency to the team, making the Lightning almost as good as they are with Stamkos. 

Unfortunately, they lost to the Pittsburgh Penguins in seven games in the Eastern Conference Final. Still, their 2015-16 season is nothing short of an exceptional one. They were able to play 16 games without Stamkos in the playoffs, winning 11 of them. They lost starting goalie Ben Bishop in game 1 of the ECF, being forced to play Andrei Vasilevskiy. They made it all the way to the end of of the Eastern Conference Final. It was a great season.

But a rough offseason awaits the Lightning. They have to resign Steven Stamkos, Nikita Kucherov, Alex Killorn, J.T. Brown and other skaters. They don't have much cap space to do so. So who stays, who signs with another team and who is traded?

I don't feel as if Stamkos is as big of a necessity to the Lightning as years past. They're stronger, smarter and overall a good team with and without their captain. There's two routes the Lightning could take: sign him or let him go.

Sign him: it will obviously take a lot of money to re-sign Stamkos. He has been a great player, leader and person for the Lightning organization ever since he was drafted. Patrick Kane and Jonathan Toews both got $10.5 million a year. Sidney Crosby makes $8.7 million a year. Ryan Getzlaf makes $8.25 million. Stamkos could argue for $11 million a year. If Stamkos signs a 7 year, $77 million dollar contract, it could benefit and hurt the team. The benefits are keeping an experienced player, who has already played in a Stanley Cup final, around for seven more years, keeping a great sniper who has the ability to score every shift and a guy who is great with the Tampa Bay community. But it will come with a cost. An $11 million cap hit would be roughly 14% of the Lightning's salary cap each year. That's an awfully large number, and consistently contending would be difficult.

Let him go: this opens up loads of money for the Lightning to re-sign guys like Kucherov, Brown, Killorn and Namestnikov. They have shown that Stamkos isn't a necessity to the team like he used to be, he's just a huge piece to a great team. The benefits of letting him go are more opportunities to sign other players, allow guys like Palat, Drouin and Tyler Johnson to sign to big deals, and bring back Victor Hedman after next season. They would be losing an incredible player though, and the risk of not having a central leader come through would be an issue.

Personally, I think the Lightning should at least try and negotiate a deal with Stamkos. I believe a fair deal for him is 8 years at $8.5 million per year. General Manager Steve Yzerman could use things like his somewhat slow starts to seasons and his disappearance in the 2015 Stanley Cup Final against the Chicago Blackhawks to talk down his salary. If not possible to re-sign, letting him go is a great route as well, but it would be tricky to establish a core group of players that will contend each year for the Stanley Cup.

What do you guys think? Should the Lightning re-sign Steven Stamkos, or should they let him go and bank on the current players becoming stronger and erasing the loss of their captain? Let me know what you think!",nhl,1464582938,nhlnews72,13,2,True,2016-05-30
61,What should the Jets do with their second overall pick?,"Many people including myself believe that selecting finnish winger Patrik Laine would be the best option. However, it wouldn't necessarily be the safest.

The Jets are a very young team with great depth in their prospect/young guns pool, with examples in Nikolaj Ehlers, Joel Armia, Josh Morrisey, Connor Hellebuyck, NCAA award winner Kyle Connor among many others. Knowing this, should the Jets Vet up?

The oldest players on the Jets roster thought 2015-16 (32 years) were Chris Thorburn and Mark Stuart who are Bottom 6 F and Top 6 D respectively. Stuart has done a great job at mentoring Jacob Trouba and will likely do the same for Morissey in the near future. Thorburn, who is a grinder, has been balancing time between lineup and healthy scratch. He has helped in giving the team the aggressive style the team is known for and what is necessary in the Central Division. He is a team leader in every sense of the word and has helped giving an aggressive edge in the game in players such as C Adam Lowry.

Despite this, the Jets don't have bona-fide stars who can also captain and mentor young players (i.e. Jonathan Toews). There has been real talk about GM Kevin Cheveldayoff trading away that pick undoubtedly with more, to the Washington Capitals for 30 year old Alexander Ovechkin. The Jets would need a player like this on their first line with Wheeler and Scheifele, although an Ovechkin trade is mega unlikely. 

This likely isn't in the best interest for management however, and I do not believe it is in my own. I would love to hear ideas from you guys to try and find out what would be a suitable fit for the Jets if they do decide to vet up in the hopes to develop players quicker.

91,Stanley Cup Final game 1 recap,"The Pittsburgh Penguins defeated the San Jose Sharks 3-2 in game 1 of the 2016 Stanley Cup Final Monday Night. Once again, it was a thrilling first game for the final round of the playoffs, much like Chicago vs Tampa in 2015, Los Angeles vs New York Rangers in 2014 and Chicago vs Boston in 2013. Now, the first game is not always an exact teller of how the series will be played. Last years first game showed that Chicago and Tampa would not let the other team get any wiggle room at all. But Los Angeles vs New York in 2014 was really the Kings dominating things the whole time, the Rangers were too weak to contend.

Back to last night's game. The first period was intense for both teams, with the Penguins playing their speed-first game and captain Sidney Crosby showing why he is the best player in the world, setting up Conor Sheary's goal to give them a 2-0 lead. Bryan Rust scored the first goal. It easily could've been 5-0 at the end of the first for the Penguins had Martin Jones not have been in net for the Sharks. He stood on his head, and stopped 12 of 14 Penguins shots in the first.

The second flipped the script for the most part. The Sharks were showing they worked on their game in the intermission, with more speed and pucks getting to Matt Murray. This allowed both Tomas Hertl and Patrick Marleau to score, tying the game at 2-2 heading into the third. In the latter part of the second period, the Penguins got back to their first period play, but the Sharks were mostly the better team. 

The third was intense and fun to watch. Both teams were playing a high speed 200 foot game, with fast breakouts and great puck possession for both teams. Nick Bonino scored on a good pass from Kris Letang with 2:33 left, and that proved to be the dagger. Despite Ben Lovejoy taking and unwarranted penalty at 17:51 in the third, giving the Sharks a power play, they were not able to sustain any pressure, and the Penguins held on for victory. 3-2 final.",nhl,1464714678,nhlnews72,1,20,True,2016-05-31

169,New to the NHL,"So, I am new to the NHL and trying to figure out a team. I live in Iowa so it'd make sense to follow the Wild, Blackhawks, or maybe Blues (they are a bit farther away and out of the way, so a lesser option versus the other two for me right now). I've been playing NHL 16 and have been digging the Blackhawks and feel something there, but would feel kind of weird following a team that has had so much success lately as all the other teams I follow in the majors sports I've watched struggle for years before I've seen success. 

So basically, I'm wondering if following the Blackhawks at this point would be bad? Would it be better to just go ahead and follow the Wild? I just see myself moving to Chicago when I finish school (or at least I'd like to), and consdering I already feel something with this team I think it'd be a good fit.",nhl,1465098870,IState94,11,1,True,2016-06-04

He seemed to give something or get something from one of the people working at the stadium but I couldn't see what was happening (I was at the very back of the stadium haha)!

Anyway it is never something I have seen anyone else do this and would love answers!

Edit: I forgot to mention once he left the bench to skate over, like he was sitting on the bench, the play stopped and he went over opened the door (gate?) at the corner and conversed with the people working there.",nhl,1465147564,LelandPereira,4,4,True,2016-06-05

186,Which should be my favorite team?,"So, i love the raiders in the NFL, i recently got into hockey and i have struggled with the problem of choosing my favorite team, When I was about 7, i went to Vancouver with my parents to meet a friend from them, he was a die hard Canucks fan and introduced e into the game and gave me a Canucks hockey stick and shirt of Daniel Sedin, currently i'm 15 years old, go into hockey about 3 months ago, i fell like i should support the Canucks, however, they are not very physical which i enjoy in hockey but i enjoy watching the Sedins play. I came along the LA kings as well, they are a physical team and their uniform is similar to the raiders and they play in the same state. I also came to the Boston Bruins, i like their uniform and logo and tuuka rask is a beast, however zdeno chara is 38 years old. I am a troubled Mexican who would like some help on choosing an NHL team that i will follow for the rest of my life, i dont really care about team success, just the assurance that i will stick with them for many following years.

220,Stanley Cup Final game 4 recap,"RECAP: The Penguins can officially win their 4 Stanley Cup in franchise history with a win Thursday night. They've never had the opportunity to win it in Pittsburgh, so I'm sure they'll do everything they can to claim victory. The Sharks, however, need to pull everything together and win three straight to win their first Stanley Cup. It will be nearly impossible for them to pull it off, as coming back from a 3-1 deficit is incredibly hard to do. Anyways let's get into the recap:

First period: the beginning of the period was probably the best the Sharks played the whole game. They were pinching along the boards hard, and made it very hard for the Penguins to exit the zone. But a rebound goal by Ian Cole seemed to tilt the ice in the Penguins favor. The Sharks had a good powerplay opportunity, but to no avail. Crosby had a good period as well.

Second period: this is where it became apparent the Penguins had ""gotten"" to the Sharks. An early powerplay goal by Evgeni Malkin rattled the home team, as two posts by the Penguins seemed to rattle Martin Jones, as he began to look uncomfortable in net. The Sharks also had just one shot on goal 11 minutes into the period, and a good powerplay for them sustained some pressure but still no goal. 

Third period: the Penguins began to ""play not to lose"" and the Sharks began to sustain way more pressure. Melker Karlsson scored a goal to cut the Penguins lead in half, and it seemed as if the game could go to overtime. But a nifty pass from Carl Hagelin to Eric Fehr put the dagger in the coffin, and the Penguins held on to win 3-1.

Side note: if the Penguins do win on Thursday, and win the series 4-1, I don't think I've ever seen a Stanley Cup that wasn't apparent that the victor was the better team. When Los Angeles beat New York two years ago, it was apparent that LA was the better, more dominant and more balanced team. But this year both teams could end up winning the Cup. Any way it pans out, it is one of the best Stanley Cups I've ever seen.",nhl,1465326262,nhlnews72,2,0,True,2016-06-07

240,Rating Every NHL Team #1: Toronto Maple Leafs,"Thanks for clicking on this link! I have decided to start writing a series where I take every NHL team and give them a rating based on their past, present, and future.  I will upload posts as soon as I am done writing them, and therefore I do not already have a list of how I rate each team.  I am going to try and post about three per week, but that may change.  I am a full-time college student from September-May and I am taking a few Summer classes which will dictate when I post.  I also play for my college club team.  My goal is to have people read this and to enjoy writing each review.  Who knows, maybe this will become something big someday.  I'm going to go in the inverse order of the standing for this season, which means that the Toronto Maple Leafs are on deck for today.  As always, comments and critiques are greatly appreciated.  


PAST:

Toronto is the league's biggest market and also happens to be an original six team.  They have 13 cups, but none since '67 which is pretty bad.  They have their fair share of legends from Wendel Clark to Ace Bailey which helps their cause but still can't fix their lack of success in recent years.  Though they did not win the cup, they have had some good years somewhat recently, with the 1993 season standing out.  Overall, I give it a 5/10, but ask me again in a few years and it may change.


Present:

When the highlight of your season is trading away bad contracts and draft lottery success, it's hard to argue that your team is remotely good right now, however with many prospects on the verge of being NHL ready, the Maple Leafs are poised to be good sometime soon. The commitment to the rebuild is surprising considering how committed Lou Lamoriello was to icing the best team possible in New Jersey.  This along with the fact that Garret Sparks can have a blue and white checkerboard on his pads makes me think that Shanahan is making the final decisions.  It is slightly cheating to include the future of the team in the present category, but the sense of optimism and the thought of reaching the light at the end of the tunnel can be felt by Leafs fans right now.  Overall I give it a 4/10, with the only positive coming from the future assets already owned by the team.


Future: 
With prospects like Marner, Matthews (I am going to assume they take him), Nylander, a young team, a great coach/front office, and a recent purge of bad contracts, the future of the Leafs looks great.  The biggest concern right now is that the Toronto market will eat these young players alive.  Toronto actually has plenty of similarities with the Blackhawks of the present.  Both teams were original six franchises without a cup since the 60's.  Both teams had an elite, goal-scoring prospect on the wing (Marner and Kane) along with an elite, well-rounded center prospect (Toews and Matthews).  We still don't know if Morgan Rielly and Jake Gardiner can become anything like Keith and Seabrook for Chicago, however the signs are promising that they can become solid players at least.  With all the young and talented prospects in the deep pool that the Leafs have, it wouldn't be surprising to see at least one of them turn into a pretty good NHL player.  Overall, their future appears to be great among their forwards, with questions about their depth defense.  I expect one more year without the playoffs, another top-10 pick, and then a good team for the 2017-18 season.  Beyond that, they look to be a contender for years to come.  9/10


Bottom Line:  
The Leafs get a 18/30, which has no meaning to me yet because I have yet to rate another team.  My guess is that this is going to be around the average, but as I touched on earlier, give the Leafs another 5-10 years and they'll make people start to forget their previous failures.  Leafs fans are soon going to be happy for the first time in a while. ",nhl,1465440740,TSN_Hopeful,4,12,True,2016-06-08

261,Some questions for someone new to the sport,"I've become pretty interested in hockey since I started watching the playoffs this year. I know almost nothing, so a few quick questions.

1) What is the purpose of one player standing in front of the goalie? Is he trying to block the view of the goalie? Is he trying to get a deflection? That seems like a really low chance.

2) Why don't they allow fighting in the post season?

3) Why do some players take shots from like 30 feet away from the goal? seems like a very low probability

4) What would be considered a ""blowout"" if you are up 4-1 going ino the 3rd period is it pretty much over?

5) How long are players usually on the ice for? Do the lines usually keep the same personnel throughout the game or throughout the season, with the same players always playing with each other?

6) Who are some of the up and coming players I should look out for, and what team are they on?

7) Any hockey stats that I should be aware of, that might help me understand the game a little better, or at least who is having an impact?

293,Rating Every NHL Team #3: Vancouver Canucks,"I want to say thanks for all the support on my last two articles.  I really enjoy writing these, and I am glad to see that there are people who enjoy reading my work.  Today's team will be the Vancouver Canucks.  I went to many NHL games this year, and my favorite was definitely Vancouver @ New Jersey.  These all happened at the game:

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7oGypNjbxs
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VireXjJj9M8
And this happened after the game:
- http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/2015/11/8/9693842/brandon-prust-tweet-bobby-farnham-jake-virtanen-fight
To make things even better, they had another game in exactly two weeks.  With Prust actually playing in this game, there were sure to be fireworks, right?  You could definitely count on Prust v. Farnham, Any Canuck v. Larsson, and Tootoo v. Burrows.  Well, in short, none of these happened.  Prust finished the game without registering a single hit in 9 minutes of ice time.  Prust was all talk.  Bobby Farnham, Adam Larsson, and Alex Burrows all finished the game without a scratch.  There were many penalties, but the only malicious one occurred when John Moore cleared Burrows out with a crosscheck to the face in the final minute or so of the game.  This gives St. Louis v. Dallas game 7 a run for its money for biggest letdown of the year, and I had to share this with you because I don't think it got the attention it deserved.  


Past:
The Canucks history is nothing too special.  They've had their fair share of legends with Bure, Naslund and the Sedins. Sadly, a large part of their history has been their riots.  Most fans know about the recent riot after losing to Boston on home ice in game 7.  This riot caused over $4 million in damages at the time and also disgraced the Canucks organization.  Many fans forget, or are too young to remember the riots in 1994.  Again, the Canucks lost in game 7 of the Stanley Cup Final, this time to the Rangers.  This riot was not nearly as bad, but still resulted in over $1 million in damages and a rioter being put in a coma for 4 weeks and given permanent brain damage.  I almost feel bad for the Canucks that this is such a major part of their history.  Beyond this, they had a pretty good team in the 2000's during the Sedin Era.  They won two President's Trophies, which exemplified the idea that they were much better in the regular season than in the playoffs.  They were always a good bet to make the playoffs, but not really a good bet to go on a far run.  Unfortunately for the Canucks, the Sedins are old now and they somehow went from having two good goaltenders and an ok starter/great backup, to having Ryan Miller several years past his prime.  On top of this, the rest of their team has either left or dropped off, which has led to the Canucks becoming of the league's bottom-feeders.  I also can't complete the ""past"" section without dropping Mark Messier's name somewhere, so here it is.  Mark Messier.  There, I included it twice.  Sorry, Canucks fans.  Their history isn't that great, but could surely be worse. Overall, they have had good stretches, but nothing too memorable that didn't involve tear gas. 4/10


Present:
Their present isn't that good either.  They just traded one of their better prospects for Erik Gudbranson who will be fun to watch.  They also traded Nick Bonino to the Penguins who is currently lighting it up on a line with Kessel and Hagelin.  One can only imagine how differently their season would have gone if they kept Bonino, and traded for Hagelin and Kessel who were both moved for relatively low prices.  One year removed from a playoff appearance, the Canucks posted the league's second worst offense and also had a bottom 10 defense.  The Canucks also managed to create their own goalie problem by trading away Luongo, Schneider, and Lack.  The Lack trade was especially questionable because he was the most recent and also returned a later pick.  This past season, I was expecting a breakout year for Bo Horvat who improved but not by as much as I expected.  The Canucks also managed to remain in the playoff race for a bit due to Anaheim's slow start and the fact that the Canucks had a lot of overtime losses in the beginning.  The fact that they took a big step back from last year isn't surprising.  Few expected the Sharks and Kings to miss the playoffs again, and even fewer expected the Canucks to maintain their spot.  They are an older team who is going to have to commit to a full on rebuild in order to succeed again.  The reality is ""tanking"", or ""rebuilding"" works well.  They were poised to have a top 3 pick this year, but were bumped down by Winnipeg and Columbus during the draft lottery.  Overall, this is a team who's begun taking steps backwards as their core ages, and their management struggles with trades.  3/10.


Future:
They might be able to have a better year next season, but don't show any signs of being in the playoff race.  Like Edmonton, they simply need too many teams to get significantly worse.  Their only real chance is if the Sedins can find the fountain of youth and put up an 80+ point season.  They would also need a hell of a season from Ryan Miller if they even want to trouble the California teams.  Realistically, this won't happen, the Sedins will retire in a few years and the team will struggle to and through that point. They have a few good prospects including University of North Dakota forward Brock Boeser.  They also have a top tier goalie prospect in Thatcher Demko who was one of the best goalies in the NCAA last year.  Jake Virtanen has the tools to make a scary partner to UFA target and hometown hero, Milan Lucic.  Two big power forwards like those would be exciting to watch and also terrifying to play against.  They also have the 5th pick in this year's draft, and probably a top 10 pick in the next three.  There isn't much else to say about their future unless they found the next Pavel Datsyuk in the past few drafts.  Being a Canucks fan doesn't seem easy.  3/10.


Bottom Line:
The Canucks earned a 10/30 which is pretty bad.  They'll rank higher than some teams, but there won't be many beneath them.  It must be hard being a Canucks fan.  I think the riots really speak volumes about the Canucks.  These fans are so passionate about hockey and the team they love, that they're willing to pay some of the highest ticket prices in the league to watch their team lose.  They deserve something to cheer about, but just when it looks like they have it, the Canucks find a way to lose it in the most painful way possible, and then the fans take their anger out on the city.  The riots are a result of the built up frustration by the fans after years without success.  They could make an incredible underdog run to game 7 of the cup final next year, and rather than appreciate the unexpected success, the fans would burn down the city.  This is a city that truly deserves a cup, but doesn't appear to be anywhere near close.  ",nhl,1465781408,TSN_Hopeful,2,8,True,2016-06-12

405,Rating Every NHL Team #4: Columbus Blue Jackets,"So my last post had a higher upvote percentage, but fewer upvotes than my Edmonton one.  I am definitely happy with the love this series has been shown.  I also apologize that its been a few days since the last one.  I've been busy.  Today's team is the Columbus Blue Jackets who finished fourth worst in the league.


Past:
They began playing in the 2000-01 season and to put it honestly, they have had no success since then.  They've only made the playoffs twice in their history, and have only won two playoff games.  They are a new franchise which makes this slightly more forgivable, however this by no means is success.  They have been subpar at drafting, with their most noted failure being the fourth pick of the legendary 2003 draft being wasted on Nikolay Zherdev.  They did, however succeed when they drafted Rick Nash at number 1 the year before.  For a very long time, Nash was the heart and soul of the team who seemingly scored or assisted on all of their goals.  This changed when he was shipped off to the Rangers in exchange for a return of several, solid players.  Even this, was not able to help the team at all as they still struggled to get just one playoff win.  They finally got their win against the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2014, but eventually lost in six.  They're a franchise who essentially lacks any real history.  Unfortunately, they have been perennial losers.  Overall, they really have no history worth remembering 20 years from now.  1/10


Present:
Unfortunately for Blue Jackets fans, this section isn't too good either.  Two years ago they made the playoffs and finally won games.  The past two years serve as evidence to the thought that the playoff year was a peak and not the start of something special.  Perhaps the most exciting event to happen to the Blue Jackets was the Ryan Johansen - Seth Jones trade.  This trade was part of the dying breed of player for player trades and allowed Jarmo Kekalainen to finally get his coveted elite defenseman.  I honestly think that Johansen was an adderall prescription away from becoming one of the top players in the league, but for whatever reason he sometimes appears to lack focus.  I thought that a coach like Tortorella would be able to bring out the best in him, yet he still struggled to reach his true potential.  I think Seth Jones is a very good return for Johansen, but I do think that in order for him to reach his full potential, Columbus needs to become a competitive team soon.  I feel like Columbus is in a bit of a limbo situation.  They've been rebuilding for years and still cannot find success.  It almost seems as if they need a major shake up, but things didn't change when Tortorella arrived.  Their current roster is built to be a bigger team who really grinds down the other team on the forecheck.  Players like Foligno, Hartnell, Clarkson, and Jenner are all big men who can play this way, but I think they need to add a few other forwards before they can truly play like Los Angeles does.  At least they have a goalie who has had a few good seasons in Bobrovsky.  Overall, their team is currently missing a lot of pieces and has not been good.  3/10


Future:
Columbus has a good prospect pool with players like Bjorkstrand, Korpisalo, and Werenski.  One player who I think fits perfectly into the Columbus system is Paul Bittner.  He was hurt this year which isn't a great sign, but he is 6'4"" and 205 lbs.  This is a guy who could probably put on ten or twenty pounds and become a serious power forward.  I think Columbus would be a good fit for Okposo and Backes, however I doubt they would be willing to sign for a non-contender.  A first line of Foligno-Backes-Okposo would give defensemen nightmares among other things.  I would not expect Columbus to make much of a splash in free agency, because their cap situation is actually quite tight with Seth Jones due to get a huge raise from his rookie contract.  There have been rumors of Columbus moving down in the draft which were further fueled by the team recently when they invited some prospects to interviews who were not on anyone's radar at #3.  I could definitely see Kekalainen taking Logan Brown a few picks down and getting maybe a second or prospect in return.  I also think they have a solid chance at surprising a lot of people and staying in the hunt for a playoff spot for most of the next season.  I think that with a few new prospects likely coming up, and with hopefully a healthy David Clarkson, that they have a good chance at seeing a big step forward.  The whole Clarkson clause it a huge ""if,"" and I think it's more likely than not that he spends a lot of time on the IR, or on the healthy scratch list.  It's a shame because I really like what he did for New Jersey in 2012 both in the regular season, and in the playoffs playing with a broken foot.  I also am sad to see him struggling because I kind of knew him.  Hopefully he can beat the injury bug and have a full season in Columbus.  Overall, they have some good prospects and a top pick, but their cap situation is surprisingly bad for a bottom 5 team, and they also seem to need a major change.  5/10


Bottom Line:
Columbus scores a 9/10 which is almost definitely going to put them in the bottom 3 of our rankings.  It's not their fault that they are a new team and that they were not able to immediately compete in the NHL.  From one perspective, they're a team who is only two years removed from a playoff run, and who look to bring in a few new prospects who should help for next year.  Another perspective is that they are a team who had a lucky year in 2014 and really are not that good.  I think it's more of the latter and that it will take them a few years to contend.  The fact that their AHL team won the Calder Cup is a good sign, but I certainly have doubts about the quality of their NHL squad.  I think they are also slightly like Edmonton, in that they need to work on finding their identity.  All of the other successful teams who play a big, bruising style play in the west, and it might be that they need to transition to a quicker style to play with the teams in the East.  This might actually be backed up by the fact that Columbus wasn't that bad when they played teams from the West, beating 7 of the 8 playoff teams.  On top of this, they only have a positive record against one playoff team from the East, who also happened to be the eight seed Flyers.  This big style was chosen while they were still in the west, and they just might have to complete a full switch if they want to succeed anytime soon.  It sounds bad, but I think in order for Columbus to become a winner, they need to have fewer Folignos and Jenners, and add more Hagelins and Donskois.

431,Rating Every NHL Team #5: Calgary Flames,"Alright, so I've had a lot of success so far with my posts and I'm really happy about it.  Each post gets around 80% upvotes which is really surprising for me.  If you really like my content, I would appreciate it if you would share it to your friends.  I work hard on these posts and it would be great if I could get a larger audience.  Today's team is the Calgary Flames.


Past:
They started out in Atlanta which makes this the first team on our list to have relocated.  Not sure if I should include history before relocation, but for the Flames I'll touch on them briefly.  The Atlanta Flames history stats out with their name.  Their name comes from General Sherman's March to the Sea in which he, a general of the Union, led Union troops from Atlanta to Savannah, burning and destroying everything in their way.  His march began with the city of Atlanta which was destroyed by Sherman's troops.  The city was destroyed so badly that Sherman said, ""Behind us lay Atlanta, smoldering and in ruins, the black smoke rising high in air, and hanging like a pall over the ruined city.""  The name ""flames"" thus stuck because it totally makes sense to name a team after an event which is quite possibly the lowest point in history of the state.  I can't be the only one who thinks it's really odd to name a team after this event.   Their hockey history in Atlanta was short lived despite not being all that bad.  After five straight playoff appearances, they were forced to move to Calgary because their owners lacked money.  The team did well in Calgary, winning their only cup in '89.  They also made the infamous Brett Hull trade which was absolved when they won the cup the next season.  Throughout the rest of their history they've had a few legends in Mike Vernon, Theo Fleury, and Jarome Iginla.  After the cup, they had a bit of a down period but managed to get back to the final in 2004, producing the memorable Iginla v. Lecavalier fight.  In more recent history, they traded Iginla to Pittsburgh in an attempt to rebuild and give their captain a chance at a cup.  Their short history has produced some good stories and memorable moments.  Overall their history is really not that bad, but could use another cup or two.  6/10


Present:
The Flames are one year removed from a playoff run, but took a few steps backwards this year.  They have stars like Giordano, Gaudreau, and Monahan.  Their core is comprised of players under 26 with the exception of Giordano and Wideman.  After their playoff run, they realized that they really needed to step up if they wanted to beat the Sharks and Kings again.  This prompted the Hamilton trade, but was not supplemented by anything else and caused Calgary to lose their step on the California teams.   Going into this past season, they had a rock solid d-corps with Giordano, Brodie, Hamilton, Russell, and Wideman, but also featured a glaring hole at goalie.  They chose to ride on Karri Ramo, Jonas Hiller, and Joni Ortio which proved to be a terrible decision.  Calgary's defensemen had a reputation of being high-scoring, but also a reputation for being a great d-corps.  This was shattered during the season, when Calgary was light up for the most goals in the entire league.  I think that their defensemen are good enough, but they lack forwards who can play the defensive side of the game.  I think if they really mixed up their bottom six, that they would be able to bring in guys who are good penalty killers, who would supplement their elite scorers.  They had a top 10 offense led by their big guns in Gaudreau, Monahan and Giordano, but this was overshadowed because they couldn't keep the puck out of their net.  Fun fact: that is and will be the only time ""Gaudreau"" and ""big"" are found in the same sentence.  Unfortunately for Calgary, they were not able to get Hudler to be anywhere near what he was in 2014-2015, and were forced to trade him to Florida.  Luckily for Calgary, they have a great cap situation, with their only issue being Giordano's monster contract.  Beyond that, they have plenty of space to make moves, assuming Monahan and Gaudreau don't start getting paid the same as Toews and Kane.  Overall, they are a team with a major hole, and appear to be capable of making a run for a wild card spot if they can patch this glaring hole.  5/10


Future:
Calgary has a bright future.  Luckily for them, they have a rather young core, and look set to bring more quality rookies.  Shinkaruk, Kylington, and Klimchuk look to be three players who can contribute to the Calgary roster in the not so distant future.  This makes the jersey manufacturers happy because this will result in mass production of the letter ""k.""  I really admire the toughness of Shinkaruk to play through a torn labrum in his hip and become the final cut to team Canada's 2014 World Juniors roster.  On top of their prospects they have the 6th pick in the draft this year.  Their biggest strength in the future is their cap space.  They have all the space in the world to land some high profile free agents who might be attracted to the idea of playing for an up and coming team.  Someone like Matt Martin would be able to add a lot to their bottom six and also would be someone who could find money in Calgary that wouldn't be offered elsewhere.  It must be said, however, that the ability to spend and the desire to spend are two entirely different things.  I think that Calgary would definitely be able to spend in free agency to address their bottom six, but the goalie position proves to be a different problem.  They have no goalies signed for the next season, and also have three picks in the second round.  It would not be surprising at all if Calgary acquired a goalie like Fleury with some or all of these picks.  Last year, they managed to land Dougie Hamilton for a first and two seconds.  It's hard to imagine Pittsburgh saying no to Fleury for two seconds among lesser assets.  Overall, I think Calgary needs their prospects to develop, they need to acquire a goalie who can be a true starter, and they need to acquire a few role players in order to contend for a wildcard spot.  I think this will happen soon as well.  7/10


Bottom Line:
Calgary gets an 18/30 which is tied for the current lead along with Toronto.  I said before that 18 would be around the average, which I still think will be true.  I think Calgary is only a few pieces away from being able to contend with the central teams for the two wild card spots.  They really need to get secondary production along with a real goalie.  They have the core set to contend in the future, but now they need to fill the spaces around it.  I think that with good management, they could be a contender in this upcoming season.  All in all, they're a solid franchise who looks to take a major step forward in the next two years. ",nhl,1466395215,TSN_Hopeful,18,53,True,2016-06-20

440,Rating Every NHL Team #2: Edmonton Oilers (Repost),"It has come to my attention that this post was deleted for whatever reason.  Thankfully I save all of my work and can upload it again.  Here is the post in its entirety with only some small formatting edits:


First I would like to send my prayers to the Howe family, and friends of the legend we've lost today. Next, I want to say that my first post went a lot better than I thought it would. The last thing I want to say is that the ""Present"" section is becoming more of a ""Past Few Years and Next One or Two Years"" section. This gives me more to talk about and also makes more sense than talking about the exact roster a team has on this given day. Without further ado, the Edmonton Oilers are on the chopping block today.




**Past:** This is the part that Oilers fans love, and rightfully so. The Oilers history can be summed up pretty well by simply stating ""Wayne Gretzky."" It goes without saying that he is the greatest player to ever put on skates, and that he is a massive piece of the history of the Oilers. To be fair, players like Coffey, Kurri, and Messier were key to the Oilers success, however it's very hard to argue that their history isn't defined by the player who has had 9 of the top 11 spots on the list of most points in a season. With The Great One, the Oilers won 4 Cups, and then one more cup, two years after he was traded. This sheds some light on the thought that the Oilers were more than just a one player team. Unfortunately for Oilers fans reading this, there is more to their history than their dynasty in the 80's. Other than an impressive, upset-filled run to the 2006 final, the Oilers really haven't had any success recently. This is probably a result of their drafting, which I'll touch on in the next section. Overall, it's pretty impressive to say you have the best player ever and to have a dynasty to think about. 7/10




**Present:** The Oilers present will forever be marked as a stretch of terrible drafting. High selections were wasted on players like Jesse Niinimaki, Alex Plante, and Magnus Paajarvi-Svensson. If you want a fun challenge, try and pick the most painful draft since 2000 for the Oilers. You'll probably be stuck deciding between 2003 and 2007. In the 2003 draft they traded down from 17 to 22. This does't seem like that bad of a drop when you consider they got a late second round pick in return, but when you look and see that Zach Parise, Ryan Getzlaf, and Brent Burns were all taken in that range, it is a major drop. To make matters worse, the Oilers chose Marc-Antoine Pouliot who has 57 points in 192 NHL games. In 2007, they had 3 first round picks acquired through trades. They ended up taking Sam Gagner at 6 which seems like a terrible choice considering Jakub Voracek was the next pick. At 15 they took Alex Plante who has 10 career NHL games, and then at 21 they chose Riley Nash one pick over Max Pacioretty. These two brutal drafts added to the plethora of other failed drafts have killed the Oilers in a league where success is clearly correlated with drafting success. The Oilers have had terrible teams since then, and in turn have had a top 10 selection in 10 of the last 11 drafts. The Oilers reward for failed drafting was determined to be more high draft picks. This seems rather cruel to Oilers fans who have long forgotten about their glory days. All this draft failure has led to some good players like Taylor Hall, Leon Draisaitl, and of course Connor McDavid. People like to say that the Oilers biggest problem is their lack of defense, but what is forgotten is that they also struggle to score. This past season they had both a bottom 5 offense and defense, and this year isn't much of an aberration. This will surely change if they can get a full season of Connor McDavid, but with the lack of depth scoring, lack of a solid D-corps, and absence of a true number 1 goalie, it is hard to imagine that the Oilers are remotely close to success. At the end of the day, their current team does have some of the most exciting, young, offensive stars in the game. Overall, the present Oilers get a generous 3/10, with most of their score coming from Connor McDavid.




**Future:** The future of the Oilers could really go one of two ways. In one universe, the Oilers get a full season of Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl as a lethal one-two punch down the middle. The Oilers also see a solid season from Taylor Hall, watch their return for Nail Yakupov contribute, and see Andrej Sekera remind them why they signed him to a 6 year, $33 million contract when he was already 30 years old. On top of all this, the Oilers also see their other prospects develop well and look more and more like serviceable NHL players. On the other hand, Connor McDavid doesn't develop because he is continually being hurt by their division's big men such as Dustin Byfuglien, Brent Burns, and new kid on the block Erik Gudbranson. The Oilers spend their season regretting not making any changes to their current roster and continue to be a bottom 5 team in offense, defense, and record. Then the cycle repeats itself of bad season -> high draft pick -> player who doesn't help the team enough to have a good season. I really do think that the Oilers are on the way up, but not that far up. I think that they'll need to acquire more puck-moving defensemen, either from the Yakupov return or through free agency. The biggest problem that I see is that the three California teams are too big and too good to be removed from a playoff spot any time soon. This forces the Oilers to contend for a wild card spot which is going to be contested by pretty much every central team. St. Louis and Chicago look like pretty good bets to stay contenders for a long time which doesn't help the Oilers case. Overall, I think the Oilers need too many teams to get worse in order for them to make the playoffs anytime soon. While I do think that McDavid will soon be a top 15 point-getter, it's really hard to imagine that it helps the Oilers stay in the playoff race through the trade deadline. For them to be good, I think they'll need to get a Bishop or Fleury along with a new d-corps. I think they need to address the fact that their defense cannot move the puck anywhere near the ability demanded by their fast, skilled forwards. If they can finally commit to becoming a quick, puck-moving team, I think they'll see some real progress. 6/10




**Bottom Line:** The Oilers get a 16/30 which is less than the Leafs, but is clearly carried by the dynasty. Without Gretzky, I honestly question whether the Oilers would be above a 10. For the sake of Oilers fans, I genuinely hope that they become at least average sometime soon.

Yes, players need to learn to keep their heads up, but that's simply never going to be the case, especially when you have rookies stepping up and sometimes even experienced players out of exhaustion and concentration forget to keep their head up.

First and foremost it should be reviewed whether the player performing the tackle saw the receiver have his head down. Several of the tackles come from long way out, giving the professional hockey player more than enough time to avoid the head contact.

Concussion is NOT a joke! Whether it comes from an intentional tackle or an intentional tackle because it was ""legally intentional head contact"", this needs to end. If a head contact is intentional, head down or head up, it must be penalized. 

Find other ways to steal the puck, use your professional hockey player skills to do that. You don't need to possibly end one players career in doing so.

But this 3 games to 1 lead Pittsburg has against us is something I have seen all too often. I think anyone that saw game 4 in Pittsburg realizes that the Capitals owned the 3rd period, possession wise they were always in the offensive zone, had quality shots, and the penalty kill at the end of the 3rd was the best I've seen all playoffs, but none of our shots went in, and Pittsburg won a second game in a row in overtime.

We completely changed our offensive lineup this year, with 3 high profile offensive acquisitions (oshi, justin williams, mike richards). This HAS to be our year, because we can't afford to keep these guys around long.

282,"Game Thread: Blues vs. Stars 8pm EST in Saint Louis, MO (Round 2 Game 4) Blues lead series 2-1 [May 5th 2016]","Game 4 of the series between the Saint Louis Blues and the Dallas Stars starts tonight at 8pm EST. 

The Blues host Dallas in Saint Louis coming off a 6-1 home win in game 3.

Things to note:

* Dallas goal keeping was great in game 1 but has been lack luster since then with a constant rotation of the two goalies. They'll need a strong showing in goal to rebound from Tuesday's 6-1 defeat.

* Dallas lead the entire league in goals per game in the regular season, thus, their offense is certainly capable of bouncing back

* For the Blues, Tarasenko hasn't had the strongest showing on offense so far this series after doing quite well against the Blackhawks. With a goal in game 4, a return to form could be just what the Blues need to see out the remainder of this series.  

* Game 3 got pretty physical in comparison to previous games. There was a bit of bad blood on both sides. It will be interesting to see if both teams aim to continue the physical game. Dallas, being behind in the series, might do well to focus on the fundamentals and try to put game 3 behind them as best as possible.

* The Blues have been fairly hot on their powerplays both on offense and defense (save for givng up a shorthanded goal against the Hawks) during the entire playoffs. If Dallas gives away easy penalties that could spell trouble against a team that is in form on the man advantage.

* Ryan Reaves has filled in for Steve Ott for the Blues while the later recovers from long term injury issues. His forechecking has contributed to stopping the Stars' quick attack and he has certainly held his own when it comes to enforcing

* Though they are down in the series, Dallas has a number of players with playoff experience they can turn to. Patrick Sharp won the cup with the Hawks last season (three time cup winner with the Hawks) while also picking up Olympic Gold in 2014 with Canada alongside his current teammate and captain, Jamie Benn. Benn was second over all in the league in points during the regular season and third overall for goals. The stars may look to him to guide their team in recovering from the steep game 3 defeat.

Edit: Game highlights

* 1st period - Dallas powerplay after high sticking penalty. 2 shots on goal, no score. This continues a streak of goalless powerplays for Dallas. 0/12 this series.
* 1st period 9:43 to go - GOAL  Blues 1 - Stars 0. Number 91 Tarasenko!!! 6th playoff goal and 2nd of this series. Assist by Jaden Schwartz

* 2nd period - Powerplay for the Blues. Hooking penalty

283,"Expansion: Assuming Las Vegas joins the NHL in 2017, where is the most likely/sensible city to host their AHL club?","Title pretty much says it. 


With more and more AHL teams trying to be closer geographically to their parent club, where will Vegas choose to be the home of their top prospects?

First one being blatant second being en elbow knowing boychuk over.  Though the second really was made worse due to lack of stick, but the point remains. Does anyone else feel a bit off about such a close series being determined by what could have been game changing non calls?


Also can someone explain the rule regarding that high stick non call? They stopped play due to the high stick injury to Kyle Okposo in the third. But then they didnt hand out any penalty. Not sure whether it was called dead due to them calling delayed penalty and isles taking possession or if it was called dead due to injury? But either way was that just a terrible call or was there actual rule book reasoning behind it?

In other words, play got called dead after a guy got his teeth practically knocked in by a stick but no penalty is called. The ref obviously saw what happened, so on ehat grounds would they not give out the penalty? This hit confused me as it didnt seem to be a case of the ref not seeing.

361,Your thoughts on the delay of game (over the glass) rule.,"Was watching the Penguins / Caps game. I'm not a fan of either team (I particularly DISlike the Penguins), so this isn't some homer whining. Anyhow seeing 3 Delay of Game penalties in a row got me thinking about what I think of the rule. 

In theory I don't mind the rule (it's not unfair, and it's objective enough) except that I dislike when a game hinges on something like this. It just doesn't seem on par with other penalties like tripping, slashing, etc. The punishment seems a bit severe to me. 

I think it also sucks that it isn't reviewable, since they get the call wrong fairly often. Of course that would delay the game even more.

What do you think of the rule? What would you do with it? Some suggestions...

1) Leave it how it is.
2) Leave it how it is but make it a shorter penalty, like 1 minute. 
3) Leave it how it is, but make the penalty can't stack with other penalties (the penalty would be served sequentially instead of removing an additional man).
3) Make it a penalty only if the refs think it's obviously intentional.
4) Make it the same thing as icing.
5) Something else?

I kind of lean toward #4 personally.",nhl,1462936747,T-MinusGiraffe,36,10,True,2016-05-10

Those fans decide things in a similar way that politics works. We vote for the Gm's to represent the team. We vote for the coaches of our teams. We vote for our draft picks. The Gm's that we appoint propose trades and signings and the registered fans vote yes or no. Or the fans can create petitions that a certain amount of fans would need to sign to be considered.

Anyway, this year I'm going to start but I have to admit that I know very little of the culture. I come from an NFL family, I follow the Eagles year round, training camp, draft, mini camps, preseason, etc, but the difference between the NHL and the Eagles is that I grew up with the birds so I'm already emotionally invested in them.

So, here's my request from fans of teams on here.. Provide me some good tidbits, info that can help me find a team. Any stories regarding the team's culture would be great. I like a blue collar team that people don't respect and are underdogs always. I'd prefer a team that's never won the Stanley Cup.

Even got the old ""You know nothing about hockey, you are from Florida"" jab from a few (I played hockey for 15 years).

I just couldn't understand how they went from so welcoming and friendly before the Caps game, to so cocky and arrogant after.

We are having an argument here;

Situation: an illegal move has happened, the referee raises his arm to let the two teams know there is a delayed penalty on the play. The goaler of the offensive team is pulled and an extra player enters the play.

A defensive player pokes/blocks a puck while the offensive team is in control, which means the defensive team was never in control and the referee didn't whistle for the penalty.

If the puck ends up in the offensive net, is that a goal or not?",nhl,1463275790,JayTheGiant,10,15,True,2016-05-14

139,Media and the NHL's unsealed emails,"I don't frequent this subreddit, so I apologize if this has been covered.  

Is it obvious to anyone else that the hockey media is under a gag order from the NHL, likely right from Bettman?  There has been virtually no coverage about the unsealed emails and how bad they make the league look.  And I'm not talking about the concussion issue itself, I'm talking about the disdain, disrespect, and outright contempt high ranking NHL execs show for team execs and players.  The one guy that comes across the worst I think is Colin Campbell.

Anyway, Larry Brooks wrote an article about the emails.  I saw it, and was excited that finally someone was going to take the NHL to task.  

http://nypost.com/2016/04/02/nhl-emails-show-players-need-to-watch-their-backs/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=site%20buttons&utm_campaign=site%20buttons

Boy was I wrong.  Brooks singles out an email or two from Mark Napier (President of the NHL Alumni Association) and Brooks' message is that the players don't know who they can trust anymore.  

Literally ignore are the multitude of examples of Colin Campbell (NHL Director of Hockey Ops) and others calling players wusses, assholes, etc.  Campbell referred to Doug Wilson as ""Doug Whine Wilson"" in one instance I remember.

There's another email where Bob MacKenzie is lobbying Colin Campbell to suspend Corey Perry.

Here's a good story about one of the terrifying emails that is being ignored by the hockey media:

http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/colin-campbell-called-trainer-absolute-freaking-idiot-1.3513577

Anyone else see a huge problem here?  I'm not even talking about the concussion issue, but the problem with high-ranking NHL execs conducting themselves in terrible, unprofessional fashion, and also clearly demonstrating that they have personal agendas/grudges that quite obviously factor into their decision making.

If anyone knows of any coverage of this story being done by the main stream hockey media, please post it here.  If anyone has links where the email contents are analyzed and summaries posted, please link it here as well.

234,It's time to call the current Edmonton Oilers what they are: A Dynasty,"OPINION:
As a Canadian hockey fan rooting for one of the Canadian teams that hasn't won a Stanley (we know who we are), I've had many a conversation with rival hockey fans and friends who love to say that no matter what happens, they're team is better than mine because they've got their name on Stanley's Mug.

Fair Enough.

I wish our franchise could say the same, and once you've won it, that's the glory of it: You can always say that your team has joined the likes of great and storied franchises such as the Carolina Hurricanes and the Tampa Bay Lightning (okay maybe that was a cheap shot on the new teams).

However, the worst offenders for the ""at least we have a cup"" retort are IMO, Oilers fans. Because they had A DYNASTY. Not to mention every record in the book held by the big G.
Gotta give that team credit. 5 cups in 6 finals in 8 years = dominance almost without parallel in league history.

Now, I'm sad to say, the oilers are also perhaps the greatest dynasty of losing the NHL has ever seen.

What makes them a Dynasty of Losing? Where once they had 5 cups in 8 years, now the oilers have ZERO playoff appearances in TEN YEARS (tied for a league record). Yet, unlike other famous losers of NHL history, they’ve have an unprecedented 4 first overall picks in 6 years.  An entire generation of the top prospects, lets just say, underachieving in the same city. You can sing praise to the potential each of their top picks have shown from time to time (Hall in particular) but can you really argue that after what Tavares did for one of the other great dynasties of failure, the New York Islanders, and the way Toews and Kane turned around what was, not long ago, one of the worst teams in the league (and then there's Crosby and the once terrible penguins), the Oilers have any excuse for what the lack of any promise they’ve shown year after year.

I'm saying all this because, with the second coming on McJesus, I think (God, I even hope) that the oilers may soon be a very strong team and with talent like him on the roster for the next decade, it would be a shock to see him not pull home a cup. So before the Oilers become what may be another potential great dynasty, I think we need to remember right now how low they sunk, and how they are already in their franchise’s second dynasty. A dynasty of Failure.

TL;DR: A playoff drought of 10 years and 4 first overall picks with nothing to show for it is an incredible a streak as the 1980's era Oilers, and should be called a Dynasty of Failure.",nhl,1460136088,Disco--Very,9,1,True,2016-04-08

It's a $5 entry fee that you can send to me via paypal. The payout structure will most likely be ""Top 3 win"", or ""winner takes all"". This depends on how many people join.

I've posted the information below for how to join. Once you've joined, I'll need you to message me on reddit regarding the $5 entry fee. Anyone who joins the league but does not pay me before the playoffs start (APRIL 13) will automatically be kicked out of the league.

I have been watching hockey more recently and I want to branch out for my love of football into another sport. The problem is I have no idea how to pick a team to follow, so I decided to go to the fans. Here is some info about me:

1. I'm a Dallas Cowboys fan
2. I live in Pennsylvania
3. I hate anything Philadelphia and NYC

It would seem logical to be a Dallas Stars fan, since I am a Cowboys fan, but since I am newcomer and a ""hockey virgin"" I like to be open minded.

332,No Playoffs in Canada. Should There Be a New Realignment?,"Should NHL be organized in such a way that guarantees Canadian teams in its playoffs? The relationship between Canada, hockey, and the Stanley Cup is so unique that an affirmative answer does not sound absurd. 

League already play round-robin among all its teams. Ottawa, Montreal, and Toronto currently play in a division with both  Floridians. A Canadian Division/Conference would not increase that much travel.

What if NHL's divisions were Canada, West, Southeast, and Northeast?

---

""Prince of Wales Conference""
Canada (7): MTL, OTT, TOR, WPG, CGY, EDM, and VAN;
West (8): SJS, LA, ANA, ARI, COL, STL, CHI, and MIN;  

""Campbell Conference""
Southeast (7): DAL, FL, TB, NAS, CAR, WAS, and CLB;
Northeast (8): DET, BOS, PIT, PHI, NJ, NYI, NYR, and BUF.

---

Top-3 teams from each conference qualify to the playoffs, plus the top-2 among the rest of the Conference  as Wild Card. Just as it is today.

---

1. Playoffs - Divisional Semifinals and Finals: Canada's teams play for the ""Adams Cup;"" West, for the ""Norris Cup;""Southeast, for the ""Smythe Cup;"" and Northeast, for the ""Patrick Cup."" Wildcards can play in a different Cup.

2. Playoffs - Conference Finals: ""Adams"" v. ""Norris"" is the ""Prince of Wales Conference"" Finals; ""Smythe"" v. ""Patrick,"" the ""Campbell Conference"" Finals.

3. Playoffs - Stanley Cup Finals: Conference champions play for the ""Stanley Cup.""

I personally think there should a timer on how long a coach/manager has to call for review as I feel they have too much time to look and decide on if they can get something called back.

237,A Case For Eric Lindros,"I admit it, I'm a hater. Back in the late 90's and early 2000's when the Clarke V Lindros soap oprea was going down I was firmly team Clarke. Even today I am still bitter towards Eric Lindros and really sadden when I think what could have been.

All through out his career problems followed him, from coaches or management or the media he seem to get under all of their skin. He let his ego and selfishness slow and hurt his career. That being said the thing that I always forgot is he was still only a 25 year old kid when his time with the Flyers imploded. Also after all that was said about him very few of his teammates ever said a bad word about him and most said they loved him.

Now that we got all that out of the way I want to make a case that he does indeed belong in the Hockey Hall of Fame.

You look at his career numbers 865 points in 760 games and it is impressive. From a period between 1993 and 1999 he scored 525 points in 370 games which is just under a point and a half per game. Also in that period he could just dominate at the offensive end of the ice and take over games. Teams needed to game plan around him and his line.

I'd also argue that in a three season period from 1995-1997 he was one of the top 5 players in the NHL(he also won one hart trohpy and finsihed 3rd another season in this time period)

Now compare him to hall of famers Mike Modano, Joe Nieuwendyk and Mats Sundin. All three players were very good and scored over 500 goals and close to a point per game. However in any season in their careers would you say they were the best play at their position or even in the top 5? Lindros was scary good at his peak and as I touched on earlier his end with the Flyers came 26. Due to injuries we never even really got what he could have done in his prime years(27-31) when most guys are at their peak.

Look at Cam Neely. His career was slow and stopped by injuries. Neely scored 694 points in 726 games and is in the Hockey Hall of Fame.

The Hall of Fame is suppose to be a place that rewards a players career on the ice not a place to punish a player for being hard to handle off of it. I think that Lindros not getting voted in this year would be an injustice to the sport.

365,Here's what I hate about analysts...,"In this article Scott Cullen of TSN goes on to talk about how amazing it is that Devante Smith-Pelly has 9 points (6g and 3a) in the last 7 games, and then compares this to his previous production with Montreal which was only  6 goals and 6 assists in 46 games.

http://www.tsn.ca/statistically-speaking-smith-pelly-turns-sniper-1.455553

After a quick bit of research by myself. You can see that Devante Smith-Pelly's average time on ice in montreal was 8-12 minutes per-game. In New Jersey it's 14-18 minutes per game. He only scored, generally speaking, in games for Montreal when he had over 12 minutes of ice-time.

https://www.nhl.com/player/devante-smith-pelly-8475758?stats=gamelogs-r-nhl&season=20152016

So is it really surprising that when you give a player more ice-time and they were projected, way back when, to have some talent, that they get more points? Analysts piss me off sometimes. They make it sound like it's 'magic' that a player is suddenly producing more. He's 'totally exceeding expectations'. ",nhl,1458320208,MoustacheMayhem,19,61,True,2016-03-18

386,Terrible NHL.TV experience,"First, I am a long time hockey fan. Growing up in Detroit, I watched the Wings go from the Dead Wings to one of the (if not THE) greatest franchises in sports. I played in many hockey leagues growing up. As a result, I am one of the biggest fans of the sport that I know.

I recently moved across country, and purchased NHL.TV so I could continue to watch my team out of market now. As expected, and with the other streaming sports packages, local and nationally broadcast games are blacked out. **What was not expected was the additional black out of games shown on the NHL/cable networks.** The end result is the black out of ~ **80%** of Red Wings games, even while out of market.

I gave it some time to see if this black out rate was exceptionally high due to a small sample size. After a couple months of the same result, I reached out to customer support to see about a refund. This would indeed suck as it would guarantee I will not see any of the playoff chase, even in the rare event that I am allowed to stream a game. I was hoping maybe a prorated amount would be appropriate. Unfortunately my request for a refund was denied. I suppose it's the customer's responsibility to read and understand all the fine print/details. I subscribed to both the MLB and NBA packages this/last year, and was able to watch nearly every game, unless they were playing the local team. 

I am pretty salty about this whole experience to be honest. In the end I really feel taken advantage of. I really wish the NHL would take a cue from some of the more consumer friendly services out there (Netflix comes to mind). I have a product I don't want, without the possibility of a refund. 

TLDR; For those on the fence about getting NHL.TV this/next year, cross your fingers than NHL network (or other cable only channels) doesn't pick up your team's games, because they will be blacked out.

**Out of pure frustration, I will update this every time I am inconvenienced by a black out.. if I remember... no promises. Keep in mind these are for an out of market viewer, with no local television option, who has spent ~$160 to stream online:**

**3/24 - blackout**

**4/1 - blackout**

**4/2 - blackout**

**4/6 - blackout**

\* I had a whole list before, I think I deleted it when I was told I couldn't get a refund anyways.

119,Discussion/Rant: Skills Competition is a Joke,"This is so drawn out and so gimmicky that I watched Jeopardy instead. Jeopardy... is more exciting than the skills competition. 

Complaints:

1- this is so padded with crap. The action could be condensed down to 1 hr rather than this monstrosity. I don't care what luongo thinks about Schneider. I don't want to hear crummy jokes from NHL players. If you want jokes, hire a louis C.K. and put on a comedy show instead of unrehearsed, unfunny banter.

2- fastest skater challenge. Go back to full-round the rink format and give big incentive to fastest skater. Thereby set a record that is pursued with vigor. Larkin didn't beat Mike Gartner because they gave larkin a skating start. This make the ""record"" useless. And it is an obvious ""ploy"" to try to make the event seem more relevant than it is. 

3- breakaway challenge. I'd rather see players try to score than try to be funny. I don't want to see props. That is kitschy and stupid. I don't want to see your kids on the ice participating in events. That is stupid. I don't want guest appearances. That is stupid. TRY! Put effort into it. 

Recommended change: players got to show a skill. Get rid of the breakaway aspect. The player just gets to choose whatever skill they want. Eg. one player tries to hit the crossbar as many times as the can with 5 pucks. Eg. A player tries for a ""hardest shot"" from the red line thereby requiring aim. Eg. A player demonstrates stick handling skills. Eg. a player dekes between pucks. Just show any skill that would be impressive.

Another possibility: change the breakaway challenge into a ""best save"" challenge. So the goalies actually try to make a flashy save instead of jumping out of the way. 

Seriously though... the event ""as-is"" is terrible, gimmicky, crap.

4 - every player has amazing aim now. The shooting contest is alright, but I wouldn't mind seeing smaller targets.

General conclusions:  I don't want a majority of the event to be banter. THIS IS A SKILLS COMPETITION. Get rid of gimmicks. Get rid of the breakaway contest. Diversify the events (possibilities: hardest wrist-shot. aiming contest with backhand. 40yrd ""dash"" in skates. Long jump. rink-wide aim contest. Most importantly make everything quicker. Condense everything. Include more events and less interviews, less congratulatory puts on the back for gimmicks, less kitsch bull.

edit: I'm interested to see if the general sentiment is one of enjoyment or dissatisfaction.

If I was an individual (like I'm sure so many of you on Reddit are) who was completely ignorant to the sport of hockey, and I started following news coverage within the last 60 days, I'd probably think he was some new hero too. Anything and everything released about this guy makes him sound like a wronged anti-hero. It's bullshit. I've known this guys name for a few seasons now, and not from any stories about him being a loving father, husband, teammate, protector, enforcer. This guy was a goon, a headhunter, a disgrace to the game. A man traded more times than he has total points?

""We wronged Scott""
""Everyone deserves a shot at the ASG""

Look up something on this guy from more than 6 months ago, and shut the hell up calling him some new age hero, bringing a facelift to Allstar weekend that was desperately needed. 
A facelift to Allstar weekend was needed, hence the changing of the format, which was awesome. 
Curious how Scotts team wins it all too, then he takes MVP. I get the game doesn't stand for anything, I understand that. What I don't understand is why the FUCK you would pull a goalie with 2:00 left down by 3 in 3 on 3 format unless you weren't planning on winning in the first place. 
Hey, people, getting annoyed at people calling him what he is on live tv. THOSE PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT. How about instead of getting your info on a 6-8 oaf on ice from TMZ you get it from guys who grew up alongside the greats. Men who played with real enforcers, guys who could play the puck and throw hands if need be. 
Scott was given warnings. Given advice, direction, suggestions. Still decided he wanted to go because.. What? Some childhood dream? Making his kids proud? He's a pro hockey player, is that not enough? Oh, are they not proud of a guy who's been waived more times this season than he has played games? They need some sort of reassurance? Or does he? Is this just to let himself know ""I deserve to be here!""
If he had done what he did to Kessel ANYWHERE other than on the ice, he'd deserve to be in a jail cell for assault. 
For those of you new to hockey, here:

Let me remind you, Scott is 6-8, one inch shorter than Chara. He's stupid big, so to go after Kessel like that in a preseason game... It's barbaric. I don't blame Kessel for whacking the shit out of him

287,"4,149 Miles – John Scott All Star MVP","4,149 Miles – John Scott All Star MVP

I’ll admit it. At first – I was probably the biggest John Scott hater there could be ( yes, even more than Phil Kessel ). I didn’t believe that goons deserved to be in the All-Star game. I didn’t believe that Scott , a player who has never played more than 56 games in a season should be allowed to participate. I didn’t think that Scott , a 33 year old Edmonton boy with five goals in 285 NHL games played deserved to hang out in Nashville among the leagues superstars. I didn’t think that Scott , a family man with two young children with twins on the way – deserved a chance to stick it to the NHL. I was fully convinced that John Scott was the bad guy in all of this.

Was I ever wrong.

None of this was Scott ’s fault. Blame the fan vote before you blame Scott . Don’t get me wrong – I’m still fully against having the fan vote the way it is now. Create a list of eligible players that can be voted for and go from there. It’s not Scott’s fault that he was selected to the game. He didn’t ask to be voted for. Heck, at one point he told people to vote for people more deserving than himself.

The All-Star weekend was about John Scott . The normally boring All-Star game can thank John Scott for bringing a storyline into the fold.

Previously asked by Arizona and the NHL to bow out of the All-Star game, he refused and was traded to Montreal (inevitably, St. John’s) seemingly taking care of any chance Scott had of going to the All-Star game.

Nice try.

The NHL did it’s damnedest to try and keep Scott away from the party in Nashville. Everything from telling him he couldn’t wear his requested AHL St. John’s Ice Caps jersey and forcing him to wear a team-less sweater, to someone in the NHL asking Scott if his kids would be proud of him. You’re telling a guy who made a living with his fists what to do and not do. Probably not a smart choice.

At the end of the day, the All-Star game is a laugh. It’s a chance where players can put on mullets and pretend to be someone else. It’s a time where players can wear a Chewbacca mask and bring their son on the ice. It’s a time where all the feel-good stories come out about all the players participating. It’s an event that players bring their families to.

It’s the All-Star game.

They play an exhibition game. They have a skills competition. None of this means anything in the grand scheme of the rigorous 82 game NHL season.

It did mean something to John Scott though. A 33 year old journeyman who punched his way through 285 NHL games. An Edmonton boy with a wife and two kids while also expecting twins. A player sent 4,149 miles away from his previous NHL team’s arena to his new AHL arena to try and rid him from an exhibition game that he was voted into.

A player who was told that his kids wouldn’t be proud of him.

Gary is not amused. He has a business to run. This is a childish antic. But marketing guy has more. We're not just going to leave it at that. We're going to turn it into an epic David and Goliath battle. We're going to turn a guy nobody has really heard of into a symbol for the blue collar, go to work to support your family man.


So they think about who they might use for this and go through a few tough guys, but most of them are dicks and nobody would get excited about them. They drop it at that, but a couple days later Gary remembers the time he saw an interview with John Scott and it seemed he was a nice guy. He looks into it further. Dude has 2 kids and his wife is pregnant with twins. Juicy.



So then it just becomes a matter of making themselves look like complete assholes. He talks his friend in the GM office in Montréal into making a trade for him at just the right (wrong) time. Then he 'pressures' him into not going. Just enough so that John actually says, ""yeah, you're right - I don't deserve it - send my teammates."" But he just lets it stew for a while and waits for the exact right time to call him up and give him the line about his daughters not being proud. Now they really look like dicks and everyone, John included, wants to stick it to them.



Fast forward to the all star game - he gets a couple goals, they name him MVP, and a game that nobody usually gives a fuck about (admit it you guys, you all usually ignore the all star game) suddenly has great ratings and has people sharing a bunch of shit on facebook about hockey instead of the usual Donald Trump jokes. Now we're all super engaged in time for the playoff run.

Well, I looked it up  : http://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/stats.html

We haven't had this few goals-per-game since 1953, when sticks were straight, and skates were made from wood.    

Is there anything to be done, or is this downward spiral of less-and-less goals going to end with us ""enjoying"" 1-nil ""hockey-soccer"" games?   

Don't get me wrong, I don't mind a nice defensive showdown - but every game is just too much.  What do you guys think of this historically low-scoring period? ",nhl,1454441737,lunk,3,1,True,2016-02-02
313,NHL site update issue/GCL issue,"Somehow in the move to NHL.tv some people's Gamecenter Live subscriptions (including mine) have vanished. I paid $110 for a year subscription and after 3 months it's now gone.I posted on twitter yesterday's and the nhl.tv suppost account immediately wrote me back. After giving my acct info, they confirmed they had no record of my subscription. Eventually it came out that if you purchased the subscription through iTunes as an in-app purchase they don't have access to those accounts and you had to do a 'restore previous purchases' on the app, which I did to no avail. NHL did not think this through. If they don't have access to any accounts not purchased through the NHL website, what's going to happen when you completely revamp the system. Finally nhl said I'd have to contact iTunes customer service. I contact iTunes customer service and spent 30 minutes talking with them, with them definitely trying to figure out if they can restore my subscription, they finally determine that only the developers of the app (NHL.com) can restore in app subscription purchases. Has anyone had this problem and has had it fixed or knows what I can do to get my subscription back?

Edit: SOOO it took uninstalling and reinstalling the app on my iPad *10* times before, when it first starts up, a little button that says 'restore previous purchase' popped up. Finally got it to work on my iPad, uninstalled and reinstalled it on my phone and it finally worked on that. Went to the website. Logged in and out a couple times and it finally worked but when I click on ""My Account"" it still says I don't have a subscription. I can watch some games (but there doesn't seem to be any commonalities between the games I can't watch) (???)

I casually watched hockey thanks to NHL streams subreddit, but didn't really pay attention to it much. I more or less kept the games on for background sound when I'm doing things on the computer. I didn't really follow any team.

Anyways, I went to my first Wichita Thunder game (an ECHL team) and now I'm hooked. I just don't know who to actually follow. 

The teams I'm looking at right now are the Blues, Avalanche, Stars, Islanders and the Blackhawks.

I'm thinking about the Avalanche because they're one state over and the closest team from my location if I ever wanted to see them in person. 

I'm also interested in St. Louis, for the same reason as the Avalanche, but if I end up choosing a team because of location, then I'll go with Colorado because they are closer.

I'm interested in the islanders because they are the ""parent club"" I guess you could say to the ECHL team close to Kansas city, the Missouri mavericks. But that's the only reason.

I'm interested in the stars because one, they are doing well right now (current leaders in their table), and two because the Dallas culture where I am is for some reason pretty strong. Like everyone in my family and city seems to at least be a fan of, or like, the Dallas cowboys or mavericks. 

Lastly there's the Black hawks. They have the largest fanbase (according to amount of twitter followers), they're the current champs, and a former Wichita Thunder player plays for them now.

I know I can like multiple teams, I just can't decide who I actually want to put the most time and effort into actually cheering for.",nhl,1452424801,Pickle_Jr,9,1,True,2016-01-10

Odd man rushes are down.

Goalie assists are down. 
Goalies taking risks playing the puck is down. 

I believe if the blue lines are reset to where they were just a few years ago we will see the following:
Defencemen in the O zone will face more pressure increasing turnovers resulting in more odd man rushes. 
Less low quality attempted shots from the point. 
Wingers chasing the puck on the dump and chase will be more effective with a larger neutral zone. 

Remove the trapezoid. Let goalies try to stop the dump and chase. 
Goalies should be allowed to assist more with breakouts. They should be allowed to make mistakes.

This week is mainly for the fans that is why the Cities that host it have week long events now and the fans get to vote the players in.

Now there's no question, that puck was going in and that was a good goal, but I've seen a hand full of would be goals just like this that were waved off because of a premature whistle.

What gives with the inconsistency?  Is it under the veteran ref's judgement to overrule a call from a rookie ref?

247,What team should I support?,"I live in the U.K I'm planning on watching a bunch of hockey this year so 70% of my decision will be based on that. But I was hoping this could narrow down the field a little and help me out so instead of watching multiple games from every team I could focus on just 4 or 5. 



I've been a basketball fan from a very young age. Didn't really have a team until I was 13 when I decided to start back Golden State (J-Rich be damned, paid off in the end I guess).



When I was about 11/12 I followed the NHL for a season or two, usually backing the New York Rangers because; 1. They were one of the few teams who's games were aired over here. 2. They were a New York team and I had heard of them. My sudden interest in the NHL when I was 11/12 was purely from watching the Mighty Ducks haha.



They stopped airing NHL and I lost interest. Some subscription based sports channels brought back the NHL years ago and I never paid it much interest.


But now I'm feeling like I want to give it another shot and I find having someone to back makes it easier to get into a sport. Something to cheer for.


Rough idea of what I'm looking for:


- Not a contender. I love an underdog. Part of the reason I was drawn to the Warriors back in the day. 

- Not the worst team in the league. My interest and passion for the game isn't there. I couldn't back a team that is doing absolutely nothing and showing no signs of improving. I don't need a playoff team at all. Would rather they weren't actually. But I don't want the Philadelphia 76ers of hockey either. 

- Great playmaking. I don't know why. Maybe it's how I was coached as a kid when playing basketball. But I've always loved watching great passing more than anything else. A team with a guy known for great passing or just a team with a history of great team work would be very welcome.

- Young talent/prospects. Doesn't have to be the next MVP. Just a team with some new/young players on it. I don't want to start backing a team that has a bunch of veterans who have been amazing and are now in their twilight years. Would feel like arriving really late at a party haha.

- This one isn't a requirement. Just a preference. But a team that has never won a championship would be nice. I'll look at teams even if they have. But I would be giving extra value to teams that havent. 

- Again. This isn't a requirement. But a pretty relaxed fanbase would be appreciated. Can't be bothered with a bunch of whining complainers or uber arrogant idiots who cling onto the past.

Since I really don't know much about the NHL besides some team history and the team locations, I decided to turn to the closest thing to experts that I have ready access to which is you guys!  A couple things I'd like to look for:

I like good defense is sports, and so a team with a solid defensive core is a bonus.

Would prefer they have a unique color scheme, but that's not necessary.

Would also like a team I can see on tv rather frequently, and would also preferably follow a team not in California/Florida/Texas/Arizona because why the hell are there hockey teams in California, Florida, Texas, and Arizona?  However, it's not the biggest deal in the world if they are, would like to hear the argument for why I should follow them!

Vancouver's not a team I'm too keen on supporting as I have other rooting interests against a Vancouver team. 

I'd also like to have a team that won't make me seem like a complete bandwagoning dick.

374,Why does the NHL ignore regulation losses when it comes to sorting teams in the standings?,"In the NHL's points system, a regulation loss is the equivalent of not playing when it comes to sorting teams in the standings.  Let's say Detroit is 20-15-1.  That's 41 points.  They lose four straight games.  They're still at 41 points.  So what they're really looking at is a record of 20-x-1 where x (or number of losses) doesn't matter.  

Furthermore, let's say the Bruins are 20-19-0 and the Rangers are 21-22-0.  In the NHL, the Rangers - at 21-22-0 - would be listed ahead of the Bruins.  Now let's say the Red Sox are 20-19 and the Yankees are 21-22.  The Red Sox at 20-19 would be listed ahead of the Yankees.  

Some have suggested the use of a points system is necessary because of the presence of ties (or overtime losses).  This isn't true, as a tie or overtime loss has the net value of half a win and half a loss.  For example, let's say the Ducks are 6-5-4 and the Kings are 8-7-0.  Each of the Ducks four OTLs are worth one point.  But if you take each one of those OTLs and count it as half a win and half a loss, you'd add two to the loss column and two to the win column such that they'd be 8-7-0 - which is the Kings record.  And this can be double checked using another method to find that each team has 16 points in 15 games.

385,The (hypothetical) Penguins shuffle,"I don't really know if this kind of post is ok in this subreddit, but I would like to hear some speculation and info from people who know better than I do.

Now, I am not a Penguins fan. I like the organisation because of its history. They seem to be stuck in the middle-lower end of the standings this year with pretty poor performances from players who are expected to perform like all-stars (which they are).

I should really get to the point : could Crosby/Malkin/Kessel get traded in the upcoming years? And why? I myself would consider a trade involving Malkin over Crosby, as Sidney is (like it or not) the face of Penguins/NHL.

Crosby currently has 24 points in 33 games. Very poor for him. But Kessel and Malkin are both struggling too, with Malkin having 30 points in 34 games, and Kessel 20 points in 34 games.

The point totals aren't the only reason why I wouldn't be surprised about a Crosby/Malkin trade. They have a huge salary, and with Kessel and Letang, money gets tight. I would rather have a team performing well, and a team with a future, than investing all for 28-29 year old players that cost more than they are worth (atm).

I have a problem. **All of my buddies are hockey fans.** Hockey nerds, even. Every gathering ends up a hockey night. Every conversation ends up on hockey. **I am not a hockey fan.** 

Now, this is not to say I dislike hockey. Playoffs are electric, just like any other sport. And I can watch it, but it doesn't capture me in the same way as basketball, for instance, which I am a fan of. **I have come to realize that my lack of hockey spirit is rooted in the following:**

- **I don't know the rivalries.** Who are the Celtics vs. Lakers type games to watch? What Red Sox vs. Yankees dynastic hatred makes this match so thrilling to watch?

- **I don't know the teams (identity and history).** The Patriots play a quick passing game, relying on great strategy to leave the opposition scrambling and rushed. The Steelers play gritty football, relying on short runs and brute force to battle down the field. These are general identities and play styles for organizations. 

- **I don't know the players or their histories.** As above, who's who historically? Who ignited the rivalries like Bird vs. Magic? Who is the Jordan? Who are the current legends (Crosby?) in the making, like a KG, Kobe and who are the current stars, such as Durant, Curry?

- **I don't know basic plays to watch for.** Look! See, he set the pick, allowing him to sneak past uncovered for just a moment, affording the opportunity to....I can recognize these in basketball. The screens, backdoor plays, etc. In hockey, much as basketball appears to the unaware, all I see (mostly) is 3 guys standing in an arc waiting for their shot and 2 by the net clearing lines of attack. 

So, /r/NHL, I politely ask for a moment of your time to fill a desperate-to-be fan in on your favorite sport.

Personally (I know it isn't an NHL game), but I think my favorite line (or at least the one that stuck with me the most) is from the Round Robin game between Canada and USA in 2010. On the American broadcast, just before the puck dropped, Doc Emrick said a line that went something like this:

He said how many people lived in the US and in Canada, and then said how many people in each country played hockey, listing the respective percentages. Then, he closed with this line:

""And out of those, these are the best 20 from each country.""

I don't know why, but that line just always gives me chills, probably because the full realization that this was Canadian hockey vs American hockey and it meant more than just a Round Robin game.

399,Efficiency Adjusted Corsi: New metric I just tested out. Thoughts?,"So I'm a Rangers fan and I don't necessarily believe CF60 is that telling since the Rangers have a great offense but terrible Corsi numbers. The Rangers high shooting percentage and goal differential prove that.

But I wanted to see it in one number to determine how efficient offenses in the league really are. Here's what I did:

1. CF60 + Team Shooting Percentage to get Possession Plus Efficiency (PPE). I'll explain why I did this later.

2. CF60/Shooting Percentage to get Efficiency Adjusted Corsi Margin (EACM). Ideally, this number would be low since high octane offenses would have high possession numbers and high shooting percentages, so the differential between the two numbers would be small, resulting in a low margin.

3. PPE/EACM to get Efficiency Adjusted Corsi. The Reason I used PPE instead of CF60 is because there could potentially be teams with low Corsi and low SP that would still have similar ratios to teams that have high figures in both categories. By adding the two together, this helps to avoid that, although not altogether, as no stat is perfect.

In short, I believe this statistic can help show what teams do with their possessions, rather than merely showing whether a team possesses the puck or whether they score a lot on fewer shots. The higher this figure, the more goals offenses score when they possess the puck/are creating shot attempts. 

Here's what I got:

Team
OTT: 14.99
MTL: 13.5
NYR: 13.44
MINN: 13.38
Dallas: 13.1
BOS: 12.7
WASH: 11.98
ARI: 11.82
NJ: 11.59
COL: 11.46
EDM: 11.38
NYI: 11.38
FL: 11.04
VAN: 11.03
SJ: 11.03
WPG: 11
DET: 10.47
CHI: 10.2
STL: 10.11
CBJ: 10.01
TB: 9.91
NASH: 9.9
CGY: 9.45
LA: 8.93
TOR: 8.5
PITT: 8.19
BUFF: 7.89
CAR: 7.28
ANA: 6.6
PHI: 6.15

I actually think the results are pretty telling. It makes sense that OTT is at the top, considering they're a mildly successful team yet still have mediocre Corsi, and the Rangers have terrible Corsi and are ranked third. Teams like ARI/EDM/COL have subpar defensemen and team SV% which helps explain why they're near the top but not doing great in the standings. And for better teams that are toward the bottom, like LAK, STL, CHI, it still makes sense because their Corsi numbers are so good that it doesn't matter how efficient their offense is because they possess the puck so much that they don't have to do well with their possessions because they're less valuable.

Some of them responded and gave me a signed photo etc.

This was in the mid 90s. Today I looked thru my old hockey cards and photos and started wondering if some of the actually are real or ""fake"". So I thought of you reddit and maybe anyone of you could look at them and see if anyone are actually signed from the player or not.

If anyone know were I could get my hockey cards valued for free with photos also, that would be awesome!

20,The Gamecenter vs Hockeystreams Debate: My findings/experience,"So, as always there has been/is a debate going on which service is better:  NHL GameCenter or HockeyStreams.   I wanted to provide input on what I've found having used them both so that it might help people choose.   This is also putting price aside from the mix as I don't think the difference between $170 and $110 is that huge a deal. To me, its all about what works.

First, NHL GameCenter.  The obvious issue, lack of Chromecast support.  Now, there have been rumors of it having it this year.  I know the Rogers site says it has it, but the US version doesn't mention anything yet (maybe its changed in the past week but right now I haven't seen it).  Either way, we'll have to wait to see if its really added this year.  To me, thats its biggest knock.  Everything else worked perfectly for me, but my XB1 is in a different room than my main TV, so I was always running a 50ft. HDMI Cable to my TV....I don't want to do that this year.  However...quality, interface, and everything else about GC, was perfectly fine.  I really didn't see any issues with it.  If you're on the easy coast however, you will probably complain about the blackouts since everything is so close together that being a fan of a team in a different area is more likely.  Me being in Vegas, and being a Sharks fan....I had no blackout issues.  And I have DirecTV so if I wanted to watch Kings/Ducks/Coyotes games, I can and just watched the Sharks on those local or nations channels if they were playing them.

Next, HockeyStreams.  The idea behind HS, is really good.  And for the most part it works. Quality is good, but still not quite as good as GC or normal HDTV.  There was some obvious scaling going on that was a tad annoying, but I could get past it.  HS has Chromecast support, which is the main reason I wanted to try it.  Using Chromecast from my laptop casting to my Chromecast, was way too laggy for it to be watchable.  So next I tried the app.  Chromecast worked perfectly using the app to cast it (albeit after I had to close and open the app about 5 times until it finally worked with no issue).  But this was the most functional way.  My issue with the app, its pretty amateur and needs a lot of refinement. However, it does what its supposed to do.  Also, at home, I have a Plex Media Server.  When I discovered HS made a Plex Plugin and I could pretty much just use my Plex App to stream live hockey via HS, I was pretty excited.  So I configured it and was able to see the games, browse and play them.  Playing them directly from the Plex App on my phone or tablet, worked with no problem.  But as soon as I tried to cast it to my Chromecast...NOPE.  Unwatchable.  Something doesn't quite translate there.  HS does say the Plex Plugin is in beta, so it may not work right but I was hoping.  If the Plex plugin worked, that would have sold me completely on HS, even accepting the slight quality degradation, but it didn't.  So to me, if I want to watch a game using Chromecast, I have to use the app from my phone/tablet.  But at least it works.  However, I couldn't find a way to switch which broadcast I watched from the app at all, so I was stuck with whatever it has.

I'm going to wait until the start of the season to see if GC actually has Chromecast support, doesn't look like it right now just looking at the videos section, but maybe live games will be different.  Chromecast support is still the defining feature.  If GC does have it, I will more than likely go back to them from HS just due to the app cleanliness and quality differences.  Like I said earlier, the idea of HS and features are amazing....but a lot of them are executed poorly and half done.

Also, in case anyone was wondering if the issues with HS could be from my local network setup/LAN speeds...there's no issues there.  Router and laptop both AC1900 on a 5Ghz network.  Even tried from my desktop which is wired with the same issues happening.  Tested streaming a 30GB .mkv from Plex App as well from the same laptop and there was no latency issues like on HS game feed.

This isn't meant to convince anyone that one is better than the other.....these are just my observations between the two.  Oh, NHL Center Ice is there too, its shit.",nhl,1443654747,THE_Ryan,23,12,True,2015-09-30

81,Talk to me about your team from a hockey pool perspective,"Montreal fan here.

1- Alex Galchenyuk will see increased responsability this year. He has been moved to center and will play on the top lines. Look for him to have a large increase in points this year

2- Semin won't do a classic semin 70+ point season, but for 1M cap hit, he should easily bring in over 55 which is pretty good. Would not be surprised to see him around 65

3- Desharnais will probably be the loser of the Galchenyuk situation. He will most likely spend most of the season centering the 3rd line with Dale Weise and Fleishmann

4- Michel Therrien (coach) seems to have changed the offensive scheme and it's a lot more dynamic and involves the defensemen a lot. Look for montreal to score more goals this year (221 goals last year, I expect them around 240 this year)

5- Subban, Petry, Markov and Beaulieu all have good value if you're looking for points, as I said, defensemen will be VERY involved in our team's offense. However, if you play with salary cap, 5.750 for Markov probably isn't worth it. BUT! look out for Beaulieu, at 1M he's a really good deal. LARGE IMPROVEMENT THIS YEAR.

6- Speaking of improvements, Subban spent the whole summer TRAINING with Ben Johnson and barely took any vacation. I'm looking for him to show increased numbers since the total goals from montreal will go up and he will be involved in most.

7- There won't be any youngster popping out of nowhere and doing lots of points this year

8- Price will likely see decreased numbers in GAA and S% but I expect his Wins to stay similar.",nhl,1443974672,bphone13,6,3,True,2015-10-04

My understanding of the packages are:
Single-team:
I would buy a single-team package for the Buffalo Sabres for $105 and I would be able to watch all of their games except for when they play Boston and nationally blacked out ones.  Is a nationally blacked out game just one that is being aired on a NBC or NBCSN?  I checked the Sabres schedule and they have about 5 of them.

All-Access:
I pay $130 and I can watch all NHL games except for the Boston Bruins games which aren't aired on NBC or NBCSN.

196,A 33-team realignment plan I put together just to see if I could,"With Quebec and Las Vegas likely getting expansion teams, realignment is a worry, particularly in Detroit and Columbus, who only recently got to go to the East. But assuming Seattle can get an arena together, I can see the League expanding to 33 teams. Here's how:

For example purposes, we'll realign Nashville to the Eastern Conference. Easier to go East than West, right? Anyway:

WESTERN CONFERENCE:

16 intradivision games (4 * 4)

30 interdivision games (3 * 10)

36 interconference games (2 * 18)

82 games in all.

That's the easy part. Now how to schedule the Eastern Conference?

EASTERN CONFERENCE:

20 intradivision games (4 * 5)

18 interdivision games between the top/bottom 3 finishers in all 3 divisions (if you finished 1st through 3rd within, that's 1st through 3rd outside) (3 * 6)

12 interdivision games between the top/bottom 3 finishers within the division and the bottom/top 3 outside the division (if you finished 1st through 3rd within, that's 4th through 6th outside, and vice versa) (2 * 6)

2 interdivison games against teams that finished exactly three positions from your team (1st vs 4th, 2nd vs 5th, 3rd vs 6th) (1*2)

30 interconference games (2*15)

82 games total

203,New to NHL & no local team. Looking for a team to get behind.,"Hello! I've been a pretty casual hockey fan for a few years now. Love playoff & Olympic hockey. Born & raised in Houston, Texas so no local team to support (we miss you Aeros). 

I'm looking at options on who to hitch my wagon to for the long haul. In college when Crosby first came out I was excited & that made me follow the Penguins but I never really became a fan of theirs, just of Crosby. Being from Houston I'm used to teams that break your heart so I'm not afraid to add more misery.

Here are a few current options:

Oilers - my hockey friends say they remind them of my Houston Astros because they're young & rebuilding.

Maple Leafs - I don't know why but I'm drawn to them. Maybe it's the classic uniform, idk. The only downside is my buddies claim that's like rooting for the Yankees. Something I'm not used to.

Wild - simply because their old AHL team was in Houston for many years.

I'm open to all suggestions (except for the Stars because I'll never root for a Dallas team) & reasoning behind it. I know this decision isn't something that others can decide for me, just looking for input. I figured the beginning of the season is the perfect time. 

Thanks in advance for your help!

Edit - thanks for the advice everyone! I'm going to watch as many games as I can over the next few weeks/months and see who catches my eye. The Wild/Avalanche game might be a good start since they're two teams I've had some interest in. Again thanks everyone!",nhl,1444286540,treyjyert,14,2,True,2015-10-08

I know absolutely nothing of the sport so anything to help on that front would be awesome. If you could link say an article on the rules and an explanation on the basics so I get can the tactics and understand the flow of the game? I've seen the first 2 ~~quarters~~ periods of the Rangers vs Blackhawks game and I don't really get any tactics or any of the like. 

If there is a thread posted recently that kinda answers this please just link me there and I'll delete this thread. Kinda more interested in the way the game works rather than the team side of things. I can watch all season and pick a team at the end if need be. 

Thanks in advance for any help and comments. 

edit. Just finished of the above game. That finish with no GK and how close the Blackhawks were. Don't really get why it wasn't a goal but it was still plenty exciting.

The problem is that I can't find any reason to say ""this will be my team"".

As an example I started to follow the NFL since I saw my first match, the 2010 Super Bowl, and chose to support the Saints because Drew Brees seemed me very good (although the other QB was Manning...).

Hence I ask, why should I choose your team?

--

Before the start of your game, each person chooses a hockey player that isn’t the goalie. This is the player you’re betting on. You must keep up with your player’s stats in real time and keep an eye on your opponent’s player throughout the game.  
Rewards and penalties are the direct result of each player:  

* If your player leads in points, you are Lord Stanley until a new Lord is crowned and must be addressed as “Your Lord”  

> * Your Lord can make one rule upon becoming Lord Stanley.  

> * If Your Lord chooses to instead, you may add to, but not take away, any established rules from previous Lords.  

> * Your Lord can command subjects to drink at any time.  

> * Subjects must always ensure Lord Stanley’s Cup is full at all times; he or she is above getting their own drink.  

* If your player scores, you are exempt from 2 future drinks of your choice.  
* If your player assists, you are exempt from 1 future drink of your choice.  
* If your player goes to penalty box, you must stand until your player comes out of the box.  
* If your player leaves the game for whatever reason (ejected, injured, etc), you may select a new player if you’d like, but you are barred from obtaining Lord status unless your original player returns.  
* If your player gets into a fight, you become Lord Stanley until the fight ends. Quick, make it count! (Make a new rule, make subjects drink, etc.)  
* If your player is thrown out of a face-off, you must stand up, spin around 5 times, while saying: “This is my player. There are many like him, but this one is mine.” (Don’t mess up, or you have to start over!)  
* If you think you can keep track of multiple players, you may be allowed to select more than one to increase your odds of rewards, but only after everyone has selected 1 each.",nhl,1443444571,warfareforartists,19,55,True,2015-09-28

37,"If you were in charge of the next Winter Classic or Stadium Series, which teams would you choose and where?","I know for me personally, I really like what's being done with the Red Wings and Avalanche game and the Bruins - Canadiens game, so here's my picks:

Dallas Stars @ Minnesota Wild - All these two teams need is a playoff series against each other to really ignite what could be an amazing rivalry. Both teams play similar styles and, more importantly, they have a serious history between the two organizations. I feel like this would be a fun game to watch, especially if both teams use throwbacks to reference the Minnesota North Stars.

NY Islanders vs. NY Rangers - no home team. no away team. And the brilliance of this is that the Islanders were on fire last year (hopefully they can continue that success this upcoming year) and the Rangers could be on a decline this season, allowing for this game to be a hard fought fight to the death as these two teams would be evenly matched for the first time in the past couple of seasons.

Ottawa Senators vs. Montreal Canadiens (in the nation's capital) - following the previous two playoff series this teams have had against each other, this would be a fun one to watch. A rivalry is there and I expect it to continue to grow as both franchises have players come into their primes.

45,Four-Conference Realignment Plan,"With Las Vegas and Quebec being the only two expansion candidates, it becomes almost impossible to balance two conferences divided up into East and West. My solution? Add in Northern and Southern Conferences. Let's get the two messy conferences out of the way first:

WESTERN CONFERENCE:

(Pacific:) Anaheim, Los Angeles, San Jose, Vancouver
(Mountain:) Arizona, Calgary, Edmonton, Las Vegas

This is no more than the current Pacific divided up into the actual Pacific Time Zone and the Mountain Time Zone. Las Vegas is in there because someone said on my last realignment plan that Las Vegas and Arizona would make a good rivalry. That and Nevada as a state is counted as the Mountain West region.

SOUTHERN CONFERENCE:

(Southwest:) Colorado, Dallas, Nashville, St. Louis
(Southeast:) Carolina, Florida, Tampa Bay, Washington

Eh. This makes the most sense geographically, but with the way the schedule's set up here, the Southeast would have to have one away game two hours from their time zone. And sorry,Caps fans, you guys are just the logical choice for the last team in the Southeast just because of how the other Southern teams are spread. Ah well, the messy conferences are out of the way. Let's move on to the North.

NORTHERN CONFERENCE:

(Central:) Chicago, Columbus, Minnesota, Winnipeg
(Lakeside:) Buffalo, Detroit, Ottawa, Toronto

Columbus loses the CST battle, but that paves the way for the Lakeside division, which, as its name implies, are teams in or close to the Great Lakes. The good news is, all Columbus's division rivals are one time zone away, so they can still air those away games on primetime.

I know, Ottawa isn't really near any of the Great Lakes. But hey, Lake Ontario, and Toronto and Ottawa are both in Ontario... It's a bit of a stretch, but I decided not to discontinue the Battle of Ontario after all, and hey, I figure travel time from Detroit to Ottawa isn't that drastic if they were realigned into the same division a couple years ago.

And now, all that's left is the East!

EASTERN CONFERENCE:

(Atlantic:) Boston, Montreal, Pittsburgh, Quebec
(Metropolitan): Rangers, Islanders, New Jersey, Philadelphia

This is mostly just what remains of the current East after everyone's been realigned, plus Quebec. Pittsburgh and Ottawa switched, so the Penguins and the Flyers can play each other three times a year, maybe four if they stay competitive with each other.

Teams play four games against division rivals (4*3=12), three games against their conference's other division (3*4=12), at least two games against the other teams (2*24=48), one extra game against the teams that finished the same as them in their divisions (1*7=7), and one game against the other three teams in a certain division that rotates each year (mostly to account for time zones) (1*3=3). So 12+12+48+7+3=82.

Rotating divisions are:

Pacific/Mountain vs Southwest/Central
Atlantic/Metropolitan vs Southeast/Lakeside

Pairs don't play each other any more than the rest of the schedule dictates. The matchups are arranged for the sake of time zones.

Playoffs are determined by who the top two teams in each division are. The two divisional rivals play each other to determine the division championship, and the winners play each other to determine the conference championship. From there, conference champions are seeded 1-4 in a final tournament to determine the Stanley Cup Champion.

Whew! This was a lot of work. But I mostly did this for fun and to try and make sense of how the league could realign. Thoughts?",nhl,1438816067,Nightlingbolt,12,1,True,2015-08-05
48,How do NTC's work for the future expansion draft?,"Assuming that both Quebec and Las Vegas get approved, those two teams will be participating in an expansion draft prior to the 2017-18 season. I believe last time teams were able to protect 9 forwards, 5 defenseman, and 1 goalie. 

The purpose of a NTC is so a player has stability and knows his future for the term of his contract. 

Let's say a player is signed to a 5 yr deal today, and given a NTC for the duration. Two years down the road, this player has underperformed, or is a bust, and the team doesn't want this player anymore, and wants to shed his contract.

Is the team required to protect him for the expansion draft because he has a NTC? Or can this be a way a team can potentially move someone that was so-called unmoveble? 

It just seems like a player could have fought and argued to get a NTC into his contract, potentially taking less money to do so, only to end up in a city he didn't want to go to because he wasn't protected for the draft.

I'm not saying that they should not sell any tickets to the opposing team, but letting them have first chances at tickets in your home state, in front of what should be your crowd is just a little bit ridiculous.

A lot of the people watching were quite confused and outraged to see this behavior from him. After the stream was over, some viewers came into the chat box on his site discussing his behavior and were quite shocked. Johnny came on to his defense saying basically that it’s what he does and that it was purely for entertainment’s sake. I personally don’t see how making fun of your friends and brother is funny or entertaining for anyone to watch, but Johnny isn’t like you and me. 

He then went on a rant saying how he is basically the best NHL YouTuber, explaining how he is so much better (yes, I know very narcissistic). This is where I butted in (username: Banana) saying how full of himself he is to the dismay of many users, then again there were users that agreed. This went on for quite a while until Johnny said he was leaving. He also stated that in 10 minutes the chat box would be dead without him (which is not true). Anyway, we moved on and started talking about hockey, specifically the Los Angeles Kings defense, then 10 minutes he showed back up. He was basically saying that I was only talking because he came back, I denied and then this is where all the comments came to fruition.
This is where Johnny was continuously calling himself a God and the fact that everyone in chat is basically nothing. This is where he said something he can never take back. He said that all his fans were his “pawns” while calling many “retards” and “losers”. He stated that all we are to him is $$$$$. He doesn’t understand that he’d be nothing without us, which is extremely unforgivable. He then insulted many users over and over again. Some of the most loyal users on the site, myself included, banded together in dismay of what he said. Many other blinded users completely ignored those comments saying “he is drunk”. Being drunk had nothing to do with it, if anything it makes it truer. Johnny is known to basically only come on to the site when he’s drunk and make claims like this. This went on for a few hours.

Throughout this time, my account was banned by Johnny 6 times and luckily the moderators, which he bashed on multiple times saying they do a terrible job, were nice enough to unban me. Then it got serious. A moderator on the site banned Johnny to try and diffuse the situation and to hopefully save his reputation. Johnny woke up his brother Domski, who basically runs the site, and got him to unban him. The moderator was stripped of his moderator capabilities and basically left with nothing to try and save the site.
Many users found it hard to believe that this was even truly Domski. He never acted this way and was normally compassionate towards other users. He basically allowed multiple moderators to leave the site without any sort of care in his heart. These were moderators that have been around since the beginning of the site creating it. It was a complete shame. We didn’t know what to do.

This went on until early in the morning (7 am CST) and basically showed everybody who the people behind this community truly are. He then came on later that day showing no remorse for his comments and basically spewing the same stuff he previously said.

I thought this needed to be said. If you know anybody who watches Johnny then I suggest you share this with them to show them who the person they watch really is and what he thinks about them.

You can read everything that went down in the chat archive [here](http://2bcproductions.com/threads/chat-archive.1946/page-816#post-87180) (from this post onwards to about 7am) 

I’ve also compiled a folder of screenshots of some of the unforgivable things he said that night. (note some of these screenshots are from him responding to other users) (also worth nothing that Jack Myer & King K is are moderators) [link](http://imgur.com/a/VfATl)

191,How the League Could Accommodate a West Move,"With Quebec in the final stages of the expansion process, the Eastern Conference will have 17 teams to the West's 15. The problem is, 17 is a prime number, which makes the alignment a bit messy, and I don't think the league is gonna adopt my four-conference plan. So logically, a team would have to move west (Quebec could be forced West as a new team against all common geographical sense, or Columbus could be moved purely for travel's sake).

The thing is, all 17 teams in the Eastern Conference, current and potential, are in the Eastern Time Zone. So I thought of a few ways to make life out west easier on whatever team moves. They may be stupid ideas, or they may be brilliant. I have no way of knowing, this is just what makes sense to me.

First off, for the sake of argument, I'm going to use Columbus to illustrate my ideas. That said, whatever team moves absolutely HAS TO play in the Central Division. Why? Because under a 32-team schedule, 4 games is the maximum per division rival (more on that in a bit). With only a 1-hour time difference, Columbus would play away games within the division at 8:00 EST. Still in a primetime slot, so while not ideal, it's not like you'll be up till 1.

Now for the schedule. 4 games against division teams (4*7=28), 3 games against 6 non-division teams (3*6=18, 18+28=46), two games against an agreed upon pair of teams (let's say Chicago and St. Louis were one pair, and LA and Anaheim were another. Each team in one pair would only play each team in the other pair twice compared to the rest of their division, whom they play three times) (2*2=4, 4+46=50), and 2 games against every non-conference team (2*16=32, 32+50=82). That would give Columbus at most 13 games beyond Central time (Colorado is in the Mountain Time Zone, so they're kind of an outlier).

Those Pacific games that have Blue Jackets fans so worried? Play them on Saturday and Sunday afternoons! I realize it sounds overly simple, but I see no reason why it wouldn't work. Then again, I'm not in charge of NHL schedules, so I really don't know.

There are some who might be skeptical that moving to the West isn't as bad as it sounds, but I'm just one guy trying to make sense out of a move that seemingly makes no sense.",nhl,1440367332,Nightlingbolt,3,0,True,2015-08-23

216,"As GM of your favorite team, which players would you secure in lieu of the upcoming Expansion Draft?","Before we start, we'll pretend that the expansions go smoothly and the draft happens next summer (summer of 2016), meaning that everyone is one year into their contracts and one year older. 

Now that that's cleared up, here are the rules (loosely based upon the 2000 expansion draft):

1. You are allowed to protect up to 9 forwards, 5 defenseman, and one goaltender.

2. Prospects who have played one season of an entry level deal (20+ games in a season) by Sept 1, 2015, are eligible for the draft and/or must be protected.

3. Salary cap is projected to be $75 million that year, so keep that in mind

Be the GM of your favorite team and write out who you would protect. If I can get a full 30, I'll do a second post with the results and have people do a mock fantasy expansion draft with the results (if a team has more than one entry, I'll take only the highest rated one).

Good luck, future GM's

**UPDATE:** *We are now at 16 of the 30 teams needed, as well as a rather unusual request for the Devils. If it's the highest voted one, I'll honor it, but it'd be cool to get another one in there. In addition, I'm looking up various formats or ways for us to use for the expansion draft once all the teams are submitted. Don't forget to upvote the ones you agree with. If there are any multiple submissions for one team, I will only be taking the highest voted comment.*

**UPDATE #2:** *As of now, we have 24 of the 30 teams done. Remaining teams are:*

 - Arizona Coyotes

 - Carolina Hurricanes

 - Florida Panthers

 - New York Rangers

 - St. Louis Blues

 - Tampa Bay Lightning

**If your team isn't on this list, you can still submit your protected players, just be warned that for team's with multiple submissions, only the one with the most upvotes will be used.**

*Also, we have a request for a re-done Blackhawks one, mainly because no Blackhawks fan has made one yet (weird, I know...)*

**UPDATE #3:** *We're almost there, just lacking a few more teams. We still need:*

 - Carolina Hurricanes

 - Florida Panthers

 - St. Louis Blues

 - Arizona Coyotes **(the current one is being poorly received)**

 - Chicago Blackhawks **(the author of the current one is asking for someone to redo his)**

**PLEASE NOTE** *If you make any edits to your submitted roster, do so in the original post, not in a comment or reply. I will have over 150 comments to weed my way through and I'll only be focusing on the actual submissions and not the comments or replies that followed.*

*All right, let's try and get this finished! We're so close to being done and moving on to the next stage! If you guys can get us to 30 by the end of today, I could have the expansion draft up as early as Friday, no later than Saturday.*

20,What is the purpose of the NHL's Game Winning Goal stat?,"What is the NHL's Game Winning Goal meant to tell us.  As it is seldom the goal which actually won a game, it's largely a misnomer.  Take for example the Blackhawks-Wild game 4 from the recent playoffs:

1st
10:23 CHI Brent Seabrook 3 
(Assists: Bryan Bickell 3, Johnny Oduya 2)
CHI 1 - MIN 0

2nd
3:28 CHI Andrew Shaw 1 (power-play) 
(Assists: Jonathan Toews 6, Patrick Kane 6)
CHI 2 - MIN 0

6:42 MIN Erik Haula 1 
(Assists: Matt Cooke 2, Matt Dumba 1)
CHI 2 - MIN 1

3rd
13:20 CHI Patrick Kane 7 
(Assists: Bryan Bickell 4, Niklas Hjalmarsson 3)
CHI 3 - MIN 1

16:53 CHI Marian Hossa 1 (short-handed empty net)
(Assists: Jonathan Toews 7)
CHI 4 - MIN 1

17:42 MIN Jason Pominville 3 (power-play)
(Assists: Jared Spurgeon 3, Mikko Koivu 4)
CHI 4 - MIN 2

18:33 MIN Nino Niederreiter 4 
(Assists: Matt Dumba 2, Ryan Suter 3)
CHI 4 - MIN 3

According to the GWG stat, Hossa's goal which put the Blackhawks up 4-1 is credited as the GWG.  But it didn't win the game.  It merely made a 3-1 game a 4-1 game.  Furthermore, since it isn't even known at the time of Hossa's goal how many more goals Minnesota will score, one cannot be sure if Hossa's goal will be necessary for the Blackhawks to win the game.

One of the arguments GWG supporters give is ""if Hossa didn't score, the Blackhawks wouldn't have won"".  If that's true, then it must be assumed that Pominville and Niederreiter still score the 2nd and 3rd goals for Minnesota - or that all the other scoring after Hossa's goal remains the same.  So in order to distinguish Hossa's goal from the other Blackhawks goals, we must apply that same hypothesis to the Blackhawks goals of Seabrook, Shaw and Kane to see what the score would have been had any of them not scored.  And if any of those three goals is removed and the remainder of the scoring stays the same, you still end up with a 3-3 game as you would if you removed Hossa's goal.

So why does the NHL have the GWG stat?",nhl,1435868828,efatnas,24,0,True,2015-07-02

26,NHL Gamecenter Class Action lawsuit email; Will territorial blackouts end?,"I just got a fancy legal notice about my Gamecenter subscription.  The gist of the lawsuit is this:

>Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated federal law by agreeing to allocate the country into exclusive territories in which certain teams would have the exclusive right to broadcast hockey games. Plaintiffs claim that this caused inflated prices for live hockey broadcasts and limited consumer options for viewing NHL hockey broadcasts. Defendants deny Plaintiffs' allegations, deny any wrongdoing, and contend that the challenged rules increased the quality and availability of NHL hockey programming, and increased consumer choice at reasonable prices, as well as providing other benefits.


Reading through now to see what all this means.  Any lawyer types in this sub?


>Under the Settlement and subject to the NHL's continued delineation of its clubs' local broadcast territorial rights, and associated blackout practices, the NHL has agreed to provide seasonal packages of single team's out-of-market games through NHL GameCenter LIVE for each and every NHL Club (e.g., a stream of just the Chicago Blackhawks' out-of-market games). These individual team bundles will be priced at 20% below the cost of the full GameCenter LIVE package. The NHL has also agreed to make this option available to Comcast and DIRECTV so that they may offer unbundled seasonal packages of single team games for each and every NHL Club available through NHL Center Ice, although Comcast and DIRECTV are not obligated to offer such packages. 


Am I reading this right?  I can subscribe to the full service (the lawsuit mentions a 17.25% discount now on the full package) or subscribe to a single team at 20% below the cost of the full package.  As a Stars fan in the Stars' market, if my reading is correct, this is fantastic.

>The NHL has also agreed to provide a 17.25% discount to the retail prices for the early bird, renewal, and full-season packages of GameCenter LIVE for the 2015-2016 season. This discount will also apply to any unbundled single team package, meaning that the price for a single team package will be discounted by 17.25% thereby maintaining the 20% discount set forth above. 



tl;dr: Looks like the NHL got sued because the territorial blackouts and such leads to increased prices on streaming services and the NHL may have agreed to more favorable terms including an option to watch a team that was blacked out and a general price discount.",nhl,1435874333,ZanderCruze,14,8,True,2015-07-02

93,"With Daley traded for Sharp, does this put Dallas in the front-running for Cody Franson?","For those of you who don't know, Stars gm Joe Nill continued his trend of off-season blockbuster trades last night by sending D Trevor Daley and F Ryan Garbutt to Chicago for LW Patrick Sharp and D Stephen Johns. While this trade certainly gives Chicago gm Bowman some cap relief to try and resign Oduya, it does raise some interesting questions for Dallas. They just lost one of their top pairing defenseman, and while Johns is a top notch prospect, he isn't ready to fill the void Daley leaves behind.

We know that Nill really likes his D Core and wants to cultivate from within (which to be fair to him) is actually very reasonable, as their current D core now has:

Patrik Nemeth
Jamie ""Big Rig"" Oleksiak
Julius Honka
Stephen Johns (aforementioned)
*EDIT* Matias Backman, a highly touted defensive prospect from the Red Wings
And John ""the Legend"" Klingberg

All of whom are very impressive, but none are ready to take that top pairing spot (despite what fans may say about Klingberg). So the top candidate to replace Daley would be Jason Demers, a right handed puck moving defenseman. 

So would it make sense for the stars to seek out Franson´s services for say a three or four year contract to keep their D core solid, and to also help promote competition from within (something Nill likes) in order to aide the young defensemens progress?",nhl,1436618814,jas0660,19,24,True,2015-07-11

166,Just a realignment plan I came up with for fun.,"Since Las Vegas and Quebec are the closest things to locks at this point in the expansion process, I figured it might be fun to mess around with realignment ideas. The simplest thing would be to send Detroit back to the Central and give Quebec their place in the Atlantic, with Vegas going into the Pacific. However, I wanted to have a little fun with this, so I'm going with eight four-team divisions. So. Without further delay...

Northeast: Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Quebec

Atlantic: Boston, Buffalo, Rangers, Islanders

Metropolitan: New Jersey, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Washington

Southeast: Nashville, Tampa Bay, Florida, Carolina

Southwest: Colorado, Arizona, Dallas, St. Louis

Central: Detroit, Chicago, Minnesota, Columbus

Pacific: Los Angeles, Anaheim, San Jose, Las Vegas

Northwest: Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg

The Northeast is the way it is because I wanted to preserve the rivalry between Toronto and Ottawa and foster the Montreal/Quebec rivalry.

The Atlantic feature the Border War prominent in the other major leagues (Red Sox-Yankees, Patriots-Jets, Celtics-Knicks/Nets, and now Bruins-Rangers/Islanders (though the Islanders may take a backseat because of Boston and the Rangers being Original Six teams). I also wanted to preserve the Rangers/Islanders rivalry, and Buffalo gets left alone.

The Metropolitan teams are relatively close together. The only real rivalry that I could imagine in that division is Philadelphia/Pittsburgh, and maybe Philadelphia/New Jersey. Once again, Columbus is left alone.

The Southeast is pretty much the old Southeast division reunited sans Atlanta/Winnipeg.

The Southwest is mostly the Southwestern states, plus Nashville. For the record, I never understood the Predators' place in the Western Conference and considered swapping them for Columbus.

The Central is all Midwestern teams, with Detroit moved to give Chicago an Original Six rival.

The Pacific is West Coast teams plus Vegas, which is technically on PST, giving the league one less time zone conflict, which they seem to worry about for whatever reason.

The Northwest is all the Northwestern teams. I have mixed feelings about Winnipeg being there, but with the Central filled up and no Seattle team, something had to give.

So yeah, this is how I'd realign the teams, accounting for expansion into Las Vegas and Quebec. Once again, I made this for fun, and I'm sorry if I pissed a lot of you off by breaking up your favorite rivalries (trust me, I'm pissed that I couldn't keep Boston and Montreal in the same division). Remember, this was more about geography than anything else.

The teams play 4 games each in the division (4*3=12), 3 games each for the rest of the conference ([3*12=36), and 2 games each in the other conference (2*16=32) (12+36+32=80). Additionally, two teams in a division will play an extra game each against either the top two or bottom two teams from another division based on the previous year's divisional standings. For example, if Boston and the Rangers finish a season first and second in the Atlantic, Montreal and Ottawa do the same in the Northeast, and the Northeast plays the Atlantic that year, then Boston and the Rangers get an extra game each against Montreal and Ottawa, while Buffalo and the Islanders would get extra games against Toronto and Quebec, bringing the total number of games to 82.",nhl,1437511164,Nightlingbolt,35,12,True,2015-07-21

170,NHL Realignment Idea,"Here's my idea for realignment with Las Vegas and Quebec City being added.... [LINK](http://i.imgur.com/IjKrg89.jpg)

**So instead of 2 conferences, it's 4 conferences.**

* CANADIAN CONFERENCE
* WESTERN CONFERENCE
* EASTERN CONFERENCE
* MW-S (Midwest-South) CONFERENCE

**Each conference breaks down into two divisions.**

Canada West (CC) | Canada East (CC)
:-------------------:|:-------------------:
Edmonton | Toronto
Calgary | Montreal
Winnipeg | Ottawa
Vancouver | Quebec City

Westside (WC) | Rocky Heartland (WC)
:-------------------:|:-------------------:
San Jose | Minnesota
Los Angeles | Dallas
Anaheim | Phoenix
Las Vegas | Colorado

New Metro (EC) | The Colonies (EC)
:-------------------:|:-------------------:
Buffalo | Boston
New York R | Washington
New York I | Philadelphia
New Jersey | Pittsburgh

Midwest (MSC) | SEC (MSC)
:-------------------:|:-------------------:
Chicago | Carolina
Detroit | Nashville
St. Louis | Tampa Bay
Columbus | Florida

**Season Structure**

6 games vs divisional rivals = 18 games

4 games vs conference rivals = 16 games

2 game vs interleague conference = 48 games

TOTAL GAMES = 82

**All-Star Game**

* First Period: two conferences play each other
* Second Period: the other two conferences play each other
* Third Period: the winners of the two periods play each other

All-star game becomes a mini-series between the four conferences. Also gives guys more opportunity to be an all-star..... Or they can just keep it the way it is with the fantasy draft.

**Playoff Structure**

* FIRST ROUND: Divisional Cup Finals - Top two leaders in standings in each division.
* SECOND ROUND: Conference Cup Finals - The winners of the divisional cup.
* THIRD ROUND: Stanley Cup Four - The four conference champions. Seeding is determined by season's win-loss record.
* FOURTH ROUND: Stanley Cup Finals

**Quick Tidbits**

* Phoenix is probably going to be moving in the near future but they need to stay in the western conference. Houston would be my first option, it's the 6th biggest metropolitan area in the US and it gives Dallas a true rivalry. San Francisco/Oakland would be my second option, California will have it's own division if this happens and Las Vegas would be moved to the Rocky Heartland division. Seattle is a distant third option.
* Yes, Boston and Montreal won't be divisional rivals anymore but they still get to play each other twice a year.
* The Canadian Conference teams do have to travel a lot more than the other teams but..... CANADA HAS IT OWN CONFERENCE!",nhl,1437592492,OnECenTX,6,0,True,2015-07-22
175,"A somewhat different realignment idea, complete with a totally new playoffs idea","May as well toss out my thoughts and ideas, assuming that NHL goes through with Vegas and Quebec as the new teams.

A couple of significant changes from the current structure:  
* Four eight team divisions, but no conferences at all  
* A playoff featuring the top 16 teams, bracketed by geography  

* Northeast:  Boston, Quebec, Montreal, Ottawa  
* East:  Toronto, Buffalo, Pittsburgh, Columbus  
* Metro:  NY Rangers, NY Islanders, New Jersey, Philly  
* Atlantic:  Washington, Carolina, Tampa Bay, Florida  
* Central:  Nashville, Dallas, St. Louis, Colorado  
* Southwest:  Arizona, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Anaheim  
* Northwest:  San Jose, Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary  
* North:  Winnipeg, Minnesota, Chicago, Detroit  

Without conferences, scheduling would be as follows:  
* 6x against own division (18 games)  
* 3x against two ""rival"" divisions (24 games)  
* 2x against all remaining teams (40 games)  

The ""rival"" divisions would be:  
* Northeast - North and East  
* East - Northeast and Atlantic  
* Atlantic - East and Central  
* Central - Atlantic and Southwest  
* Southwest - Central and Northwest  
* Northwest - Southwest and North  
* North - Northwest and Northeast  

These rival divisions would play each other three times with the home advantage flip-flopping each year (if you look at a map, you can make a rough loop around North America and cycle it clockwise one year and counterclockwise the next to show how the home and away cycle would work).  Yes, this does damper the Philly/Pittsburgh rivalry a little bit (there just isn't a way to put Philly and Pittsburgh together in a four-team division unless neither of them wants to be in the same division with the New York teams and then who would you put for a fourth with the New York teams in that case?) and does mean Detroit would face more travel to the west, but in the case of Detroit, it's four additional games in the Mountain and Pacific zones every two years.

Without conferences, take the best 16 records (there would have to be consideration given to whether all eight division winners must qualify, but it would be a rare instance for a division winner to be lower than 16th overall).  Now, here's how you bracket the playoffs.  Split the 16 teams in half, east and west first.  Then split them again.  In the West, split the eight teams east and west a second time, creating a Central and a Pacific bracket.  In the East, split them north and south instead, creating a Northeast and an Atlantic bracket and then seed by record within those brackets.  The playoffs now not only feature the 16 best teams, but they will be bracketed in a way that they should bring about a lot of the old divisional playoff rivalries once more.  Once the regional brackets are played, then you could have a seeded semi-final or an East/West final (as is done now) to see who will play for the Stanley Cup.

The major quibble will likely be with how to handle the New York teams if more than one makes the playoffs like they would have this past year.  My preference would be to (unfortunately) stick with geography and split them if necessary.  Basically, the Devils would get priority to go to the Atlantic bracket and the Islanders would be prioritized to the Northeast bracket, with the Rangers moving to one or the other.  This doesn't preclude the Devils from going to the Northeast should, say, Philly, Columbus, Washington, and Tampa all make the playoffs to form the Atlantic bracket, but generally, I think of New Jersey being closer to Philly and the Islanders being closer to Boston if a split were necessary.

I am a filmmaker and a huge hockey fan. I am currently working on a documentary to shoot this summer and wanted some feedback from a community I trust. I cannot discuss too much detail about the film yet, but I will answer as many questions as I can.

If you could please help me out and fill out this short 10 question survey I would greatly appreciate it. They are very open ended questions and I encourage you to write as much or as little as you like, every answer helps.

Thank you very much!

99,Let's get something straight here.,"These ticket ""problems"", for fucks sake, are for less than 10% of the seats in the entire arena. I went to plenty of playoff games, there are literally thousands of opposing fans. That 7% of seats not being sold to Blackhawk fans are nothing, actually, i'm pretty sure this isn't the first time in sports history that there has been such a policy. The lady getting kicked out? She was being offensive and taunting the fans surrounding her, which is why she was escorted out. The remarks being made on the front page are extremely salty, and immature. She didn't get kicked out because she was ""cheering"". None of you probably read the article about the army captain either, because that shit was squashed almost immediately. Sure the lightning aren't an original 6 team, but they for sure have beaten half of them on their way here. You all need to take a step back and realize that what the lightning are doing is no different from things that happen in other sports, even other teams. And for fucks sake, we're in the top 10 for attendance, I'm not sure you can sit here and compare us to the  Panthers or Hurricanes, its fucking ridiculous.",nhl,1433620157,WRiPSTER,13,3,True,2015-06-06

Will they have Arizona play out of a college arena (I know Arizona is getting a D1 NCAA hockey team) until the situation is resolved? And even if they find another arena, how will they generate ticket sales for a team that has already reported a huge financial loss last year? I've been a fan of the NHL since the late 90s and this is the first time I've seen something like this happen, or at least been old enough to understand what was going on.

235,Stanley Cup Finals Game 5 vs. Tampa Bay METROCON,"I want to reflect on my experiences at the 2015 Stanley Cup Finals game tonight.

~~The Tampa Bay Times Forum~~ Amalie Arena and the Tampa Bay Convention Center are no more than half a mile from one another. And tonight, like many nights they had competing events going on. The Lightning playing the Blackhawks, and METROCON. I didn't know what metrocon was so I had to do some [research](http://www.metroconventions.com/control.cfm?ID=602) when I came home and found out that is Florida's largest Anime convention. It's been held in Tampa since 2003, and at the Tampa Bay Convention Center since 2005.

These coinciding events meant that fans of both Anime and the NHL would be mingling, using the same parking garages, eating at the same places, and seeing one another in the streets. And some of the interactions I saw were disgusting. Some NHL fans were openly, and loudly commenting on how ""the freaks"" walking around are scaring their children. The parking attendant I paid my money to commented ""jesus, look at these freaks"" as they exited the garage on foot. And at first, I was with the majority, I stared a little at the odd costumes, large fake weapons, and wanted to comment on how weird it was. 

But then it hit me, what the fuck do I as a hockey fan have to judge these people with? they're doing the exact same as me, dressing up as people they admire, enjoy and care about, joining together in common meeting places to talk about their shared interests, and attempting to have a good time. Is that any better than the dozen of drunken assholes wearing blue and white sweaters, standing in a parking lot and watching a giant screen of younger-than-them kids skating on ice? 

I love the Lightning, and I fucking love hockey, so much so I drove an hour north, paid for parking to stand in a fucking parking lot to watch a bunch of kids play a sporting event in a crowd of similarly dressed and like-minded people. But the way that some people were treating the Anime fans was ridiculous and shameful, screaming nasty comments and physically threatening some of them. 


I just felt that I needed to tell someone about this, and was hoping this would be a good place to explain what I saw. And by no means want this to be me lumping all Lightning (and Blackhawk) fans into one ignorant and hateful group, I have many great experiences as a hockey fan in Tampa. But cannot say tonight was one of my most proud moments; I'm guessing that the sheer amount of people around Tampa tonight brought out a lot of the assholes. 


TL;DR: Hockey and Anime fans are one in the same.

346,"Should The NHL Adopt A ""Larry Bird"" Salary Cap Exception?","For those of you who aren't aware of what the ""Larry Bird"" Exception is let me first explain. The NBA adopted a rule in which allows teams to exceed the salary cap by means of re-signing players of their own. To qualify as one of these qualifying veteran free agents or ""Bird free agents"" a player must have played three seasons without being waived or changing teams via free agency. These Bird Exception contracts can be up to 5 years in the NBA and up to a value of a maximum amount as defined by the CBA. 

The TLDR of this is this salary exception allows teams to exceed the salary cap without penalty in order to retain the players they've had playing for them. 

Which is something you sometimes hear complaints about in the NHL. It also avoids teams having to make the Kovalchuk offers that are insanely long in hopes of burring salary in years down the road. 

With all that in mind, would you be in favor of the NHL adopting a similar exception?

I know we are just a few years removed from a lockout that saw us miss half of a season, and the odds of getting something like this added into the CBA right now are small, but just wanted to see what the interest from the fans might look like.

Why does the NHL use points earned instead of points per game or percentage to sort the teams?

In the NBA or MLB, if team A is 20-19 and team B is 21-22, team A is listed ahead of team B.  But in  the NHL, team B - despite having a worse games above/below .500 and a worse percentage - is listed ahead of team A.  

Many people claim this is because the NHL has ties (or now overtime losses).  But that can't be the reason, as a tie (or now an overtime loss) is precisely equivalent to half a win and half a regulation loss.

Furthermore, by using points earned, it effectively makes a regulation loss equivalent to not playing.  For example, a 10-8-2 team with 22 points will still have 22 points if they lose their next two games and are 10-10-2.

0,Mock expansion draft scenario,"Hello,

Its that time of year again! I know that there is not any pending expansion and there most likely will not be for some time, but I am asking what if there was a team coming to Quebec, Las Vegas or Seattle?

What I am looking for is a list of players that your team would protect, leave exposed and any trades your franchise would offer to have their players selected or not selected.

The Rules are:

Teams can protect either 1 goalie, 5 defense men and 9 forwards 

OR ""2 goalies, 3 defense men and 7 forwards.""

If you go the two goalie route, at least one goalie left unprotected must have played in at least 10 games last season OR 25 games in the last two seasons combined. One game must be at least 31 minutes. 

Each team must leave unprotected at least one defenseman who appeared in 40 games last season OR 70 games in the last two seasons combined. 

Each team must leave unprotected at least two forwards who appeared in 40 games last season OR 70 games in the last two seasons combined. 

Players who have played in 49 or fewer career games are automatically exempt and do not need to be protected. 


Somewhat important is that teams can make trades with the expansion team as incentive for them to select or not select a certain player. (San Jose did this in the last expansion draft with Evgeni Nabkov). 


If you think your team would like to offer such a trade just include it in your post.

Also, Please list the players exposed in your post, as this will make it easier to sort out the available players later.


Free agents are not eligible for protection or selection.


Also, upon research in past years expansion teams have not been able to select first overall in the draft, and are granted the forth overall selection.

I know that this has come up recently but I feel this is somewhat different as it is coming after the season.

It would be fun to get every team listed and do a mock expansion draft. 

Have fun!

I never realized how much hitting is part of his game and I fucking love it.  This guy is a beast.  He is having the best year (my opinion) that I have seen since coming into the league.

They remind me a lot of my hawks from around 2008/2009, right before they put it all together.  A few pieces are missing,  a little depth, and you guys are stacked. Dont feel bad about losing. The Hawks are just too deep, and have too much experience,  and even with those advantages, 3 of the games still could of went either way. The wild hung with one of the best teams of the past decade, and although the series final doesn't show it, it was a close, well fought series.
The hawks have major cap issues next year, as do the blues. I can see Minnesota filling that void soon if they can keep the pieces in place and add a bit.
Great series guys.

168,Any rules that could be changed?,"What are some rules you would take out of the game? Maybe change just a little bit?

For me, I'd get rid of the trapezoid now that we have hybrid icing. The trapezoid was dumb to begin with IMO because it led to some players racing down for a non-icing puck when the goalie could just play it and avoid any unnecessary/dangerous collisions. Now that there's hybrid icing and no more racing to touch the puck, the trapezoid just seems useless, especially when you see a goalie get penalized when he's trying settle the puck down and his stick touches it an inch in the restricted area. I've seen that burn teams a number of times and it just seems ridiculous.

238,NBC National Broadcasts have problems....,"First of all, on my television, the score-bar at the top is way off-center. One of the team's score is invisible. They don't get the whole offensive zone in the camera, and you often can't see the defenseman receive the puck when a low-to-high pass to the point is made.

Then there's the broadcasting decisions. After today's Game 1, they went to a commercial break almost immediately after time expired. That's just unacceptable. Every other broadcast I've ever seen on any other channel will show the players congratulating the goalie, etc. There's just no excuse for that, ever.

Additionally, replays are shown so soon after a goal is scored (with the sound getting messed up / quieted) that one cannot easily see the crowd's reaction. This even happens on NBCSN.

So in norway right now, a Football/Soccer player called Martin Ødegaard is a 15 year old talent. By the norwegian media he is predicted to be the best player in the world, But the world would say hes gonna be in the top 20-30 when hes at his best. Even though i kinda know Martin, i try not to be biased. 

Anyways, this was the case when Zuccarello moved to the NHL. Me, only watching Football and NBA, And poker if you count that, i was wondering, how good is Zucca really? Media is saying hes really essential to NYR in norway, but i question it as Norwegian media is quick to hype up their own countrymen.

408,The Stanley Cup Finals should take place in a neutral city.,"So... there is nothing more cheesy then watching the visiting team win the Stanley Cup. A whole 100 fans are cheering, and the rest are bummed out beyond belief. 

I think the Stanley Cup should be held in a neutral city which gets announced at the start of the playoffs. All teams who didn't make the playoffs have an equal chance to host the Stanley Cup finals in their city.

For this to work properly, all season passes for these games at that stadium need to be NULL and VOID. This will give an equal chance to fans of both teams (just like Superbowl, for example) to purchase tickets and cheer for their team.

I think this would create a much more exciting environment for the finals and create a much more entertaining finish no matter who wins the cup at the end. Celebrations would be equally as epic, even if it is the ""visiting"" team who is winning.

39,No shutout for Hiller in Flames v Oilers,"In the Flames/Oilers game from last night (4/4/2015), Jonas Hiller came into the game in relief of Karri Ramo at approximately the one-minute mark of the game. Ramo was not credited with any saves in that minute or so. Hiller made 27 saves over the rest of the game and earned a 4-0 win for his team. He will not be credited with an individual shutout, although his team will have earned one in the records.

Anybody else find that to be bogus? I could almost see the logic in not awarding an individual shutout if two goalies had to make some number of saves, and they don't want to award fractional shutouts. But if one goalie makes no saves, then really no goaltending was shared, all the goaltending was done by the other guy. I know that's not true in some ways, but certainly one of the goalies was not required to stop the puck.

I dunno, this bugs me. Especially because this will probably be instrumental in my fantasy hockey championship matchup. Thanks for letting me vent.

Definition of shutout from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutout#Ice_hockey):

>In the event a shutout happens while using several goaltenders, the shutout will be credited to the team who shut out the opponent; however, no single goaltender will be awarded the shutout.",nhl,1428279845,mojotooth,1,6,True,2015-04-05

 Mtl can clinch the division with 1 point or a TBL Loss in anyway or MTL Winning in any fashion.
 TBL can clinch the division if they win and mtl loses in regulation. Because of Better ROW.
 Det can clinch a divisional spot with a win against Carolina on Saturday night.
 Ott can clinch a playoff spot by getting 1 point
 Ott can clinch a divisional spot if they win in any fashion and det loses in regulation.
 Bos can clinch a wild card spot if they win and ott loses in regulation. (They would be tied in points but BOS holds the tiebreaker due to better ROW.)
 Pit can clinch a playoff spot against the NYI on Friday night with a win; they can also clinch a playoff spot on Saturday against the Buffalo sabres.
 Wash can clinch home ice in the first round with a NYI regulation loss. if NYI get a single point they cant clinch until Saturday if the NYI Lose in any fashion there. If the NYI win vs PIT and WSH losses they need NYI to Lose In any fashion on Saturday.
 NYI can clinch a divisional spot with a win against pit in any fashion.

 NYR can not move from 1st in the eastern conference as they are president trophy winners. 


 Western Conference.

 STL can clinch home ice advantage throughout the WCF with a win in any fashion and a ducks loss in any fashion.
 ANA can clinch home ice advantage throughout the WCF with a win in any fashion (they hold the ROW advantage over STL. 42 to 41.
 If both ANA and STL win but ANA wins in a S/O and STL wins in regulation or OT they will have the same ROW so it goes based on points per team in games against each other since They played 3 games the extra game is removed from the equation and because they both got 2 points in their 1 home game against each other we have to go to goal differential in which STL wins easily with a + 45 to +9 GF/GA differential (ATM) 
 CHI can clinch a divisional spot with a win over COL or an OT/SO win as well. Or a MIN Loss to STL on Saturday.
 MIN can clinch a divisional spot with a win in any fashion and a CHI regulation loss (due to higher ROW.)
 VAN can clinch a divisional spot with a win or OT/SO loss to EDM on Saturday. Or If CGY losses to WPG in any fashion.
 CGY can clinch a divisional spot with a regulation or OT win against WPG. And a regulation loss for VAN.
 If VAN losses in regulation and CGY wins in an S/O both teams will be tied in Points (99) and ROW (41) in this case it would come down to who has more points in games between the 2 teams. Cgy got more points in the season series 5 to van's 4 points cgy would get the divisional spot.

125,Have the Senators not already clinched a playoff spot?,"I'm an NHL newbie, but it seems to me that the Sens are already in the playoffs:

Even if the Sens lose and Boston and Pittsburgh both win, the Sens would be tied for points with the Bruins.

So the next tie breaker is the points for/against Sens/Bruins. By my count, they're tied 15-15:

* Sat, 1 Nov 2014 	Senators 	Bruins	7:00 PM 	FINAL OTT (2) - BOS (4)
* Sat, 13 Dec 2014 	Senators 	Bruins 	1:00 PM 	FINAL OTT (3) - BOS (2) SO 
* Sat, 3 Jan 2015 	Senators 	Bruins 	1:00 PM 	FINAL OTT (3) - BOS (2) OT 
* Tue, 10 Mar 2015 	Bruins 	Senators	7:30 PM 	FINAL BOS (3) - OTT (1)
* Thu, 19 Mar 2015 	Bruins 	Senators	7:30 PM 	FINAL BOS (4) - OTT (6)

I'm not even sure if it goes further, since Boston has 3 home games and the Sens only have 2, so the first Boston home game is eliminated, meaning the Sens lead in goals 13-11.

Regardless, the final tie breaker is GF/GA average. Right now the Sens are at +21, and the Bruins are at +3.

So for the Bruins to bump the Sens, doesn't that mean that not only do the Sens need to lose, but they need to lose by like 10 goals; and not only do the Bruins need to win, but they need to win by like 10 goals.

So it's mathematically impossible for the Sens not to make the playoffs.",nhl,1428677897,blindsight,4,1,True,2015-04-10

Recently I read that Buffalo has guaranteed themselves at least the 1st or 2nd overall pick of the draft. Can they get very unlucky, even with their high chance of being dealt a 1st,2nd, or 2rd rounder? And can a team like L.A. get lucky and get McDavid or Eichel or the 3rd overall? That would be nuts.

180,"Rangers vs. Penguins - Recipe for disaster, or an upset?","A lot of people are really counting the Pens out of this one early.  Much of that is because of the way in which they've performed the past two weeks or so.  Needless to say, with Crosby and Malkin healthy, this team could do anything.

I watched both teams on film a bit, looked at some numbers, and noticed a few things.

1 - The Rangers (as a whole) have a lot more depth, but this could go unsaid.  

2 - Lundqvist struggled to stay healthy but still managed to put up 30 wins along with a .922 save percentage and 5 shutouts.  His backup, Cam Talbot actually posted better numbers in his 30 starts with a .926 save percentage, and 5 shutouts as well.

3 - The Rangers team had 11 shutouts among three goalies.  Marc-Andre Fleury had 10 shutouts himself; considered by some to be team MVP this year.

4- As said, the Rangers do have a lot of depth; but they're scoring is somewhat unbalanced.  Rick Nash leads the team with 42 goals, which is 21 greater than the second highest scorer (2 tied with 21).  Shutting down Nash could be the key to stopping the Rangers attack.  The Penguins have three players with 25+ goals (Crosby 28, Malkin 28, Hornqvist 25).  Malkin and Hornqvist both missed time due to injuries.  Having them healthy again could be dangerous. 

5 - Don't sleep on Martin St. Louis.  He's a proven playoff performer with 41 goals and 83 points in 88 games.  A lower body injury sustained in March slowed him down a bit, but that shouldn't have much effect on him at this point.  

6 - Not having Letang could result in a nightmare for the Penguins.  Just look at how they have played without him thus far.  A lot of people consider this the primary reason why the Penguins will struggle to pull off an upset. 

7 - Watch out for Chris Kreider to emerge as a top player in this series.  He's coming off of his first full-season, and has already scored 11 goals in 41 playoff games at the age of 23.  Last year, he had 5 in the Rangers cup run.  

I think the winner of this series will take it in 6 games.  By the end of game three, I think the momentum will tell us a lot about which way this one goes.",nhl,1428878770,Croat32,7,1,True,2015-04-12

Honestly, the guy is one of the most exciting players in the league. He has a killer shot, lays big hits, and when he carries and passes the puck, magic happens. Despite being an offensive defenseman, he also works hard to be defensively responsible. Sure he can be a little showy, but if you watch his interviews, he always takes a humble, team first approach. He comes from a good family and is a good ambassador to hockey.  What gives?  Let's hear it people!",nhl,1429369990,hurray4kimchi,65,13,True,2015-04-18

Any other sport would have created a big spectactle show, drama, advertising for days...

I do like that I didn't have to wait forever to see the picks.

The leafs have just cleaned their scouting staff and going into a new mentality, while the Oilers....are going to do the same thing.

460,Are the Senators not being physical *enough?*,"Two games in the Senators are being outshot by a team with better goaltending. You don't need to look at advanced stats to know that's a bad sign. I know the games have been tight, but it seems like the Habs are controlling play much better, and it's only a matter of time before they start winning with a bigger margin. I think the Sens need to start stirring the pot a little more. A few fights and big hits could send the game into chaos, which generally takes goaltending out of the equation, or at least minimizes the impact. I know it's been chaotic already, but it's stayed surprisingly tame on the ice (barring a few moments) despite that. They have a considerable size advantage over the Habs. I think we'll see some punches thrown if they get off to a bad start tonight.

Really, what else could they do aside from ""put more pucks on net,"" or ""give up fewer chances up close"" to make this a winnable series?",nhl,1429485971,TheMonkeysTail,6,2,True,2015-04-19

What I don't get is how it determines the position the team gets in the draft.  Are all teams given a set of numbers, so Buffalo would be given more and Boston given less, and the number one spot is the only drawing? So out of the 4 numbers drawn the team with the matching set is the winner? ",nhl,1429490792,shazo85,2,0,True,2015-04-19

466,I calculated the odds for the Oilers to get the #1 pick at least 4 of the last 6 years. Honestly not as shocking as I was expecting.,"So the odds of them getting *at least* 4 of the last 6 #1 picks are 2.00%, or 1 in 50. Very slim, but not as ridiculous as you might think, mostly due to the rules in 2010 and 2011 (where only the bottom 5 teams could supplant them, so they had a 48.2% chance of hanging on to it). Then consider that by taking the past 6 years alone, you're stacking the numbers in the worst possible way against the Oilers, since starting to count when their luck begins artificially inflates the improbability (yes, I also get frustrated when commentators compare the past ""6 games"" of one team with the past ""9 games"" of another just to pull the stats they want).

So, it was feasible. Maddening and excruciating, but feasible that this would happen. So if the fact that Edmonton's previous wins were in some of the least talented draft classes wasn't enough to convince you it's not a conspiracy, hopefully the odds will convince you. We'll see far more improbable things in the season to come. 

Basically, the odds of them getting at least 4 #1's are 100% minus the odds of getting just 1, just 2, and just 3 #1 picks. Here's a link to a google doc where I calculated it. Took about an hour.

492,Putting Edmonton's drafts in context with the other major sports leagues,"Edmonton won the McDavid sweepstakes, much to the dismay of my Sabres. But there's been a collective sadness on behalf of McDavid, because Edmonton has been the place for future stars to go die. They should honestly be such a stacked team loaded with stars at this point, it's unbelievable that they still end up towards the bottom every year.

Their drafting spots have been unprecedented, with now their 4th #1 pick in 7 years. That's insane. To see how crazy this sort of thing is, I wanted to see what Edmonton's record would look like if they picked the players that the teams drafting in the same spots in the other major sports- NFL, MLB, and NBA- picked.

In the last ten years the Oilers have picked:

2005- 25th  
2006- 45th (traded 17th)  
2007- 6th  
2008- 14th  
2009- 10th  
2010- 1st  
2011- 1st  
2012- 1st  
2013- 7th  
2014- 3rd  
2015- 1st  

So if they were a team in the other major sports, here's what the last 10 years of Oilers players would look like:


Year | Draft Position | NFL | Position | MLB | Position | NBA | Position |
----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|  
2005|25|Jason Campbell|QB|Matt Garza|RHP|Rashad McCants|SG|  
2006|45|LenDale White|RB|Jason Taylor|SS|Louis Williams|PG|   
2007|6|LaRon Landry|S|Ross Detwiler|LHP|Yi Jianlian|PF|   
2008|14|Chris Williams|OT|Aaron Hicks|OF|Joe Alexander|SF|  
2009|10|Michael Crabtree|WR|Drew Soren|RHP|Brandon Jennings|PG|  
2010|1|Sam Bradford|QB|Bryce Harper|OF|John Wall|PG|   
2011|1|Cam Newton|QB|Gerrit Cole|RHP|Kyrie Irving|PG|   
2012|1|Andrew Luck|QB|Carlos Correa|SS|Anthony Davis|PF|  
2013|7|Johnathan Cooper|G|Hunter Dozier|SS|Ben McLemore|SG|  
2014|3|Blake Bortles|QB|Carlos Rodon|LHP|Andrew Wiggins|SG|   
2015|1|Jameis Winston?|QB|Brendan Rodgers?|SS|Karl-Anthony Towns?|C|  

Now, with those kinds of players.... do you really think they'd still be anywhere near the bottom, or are the Oilers just really that bad?

I find my PC is poor, but has the most options as far as multiple views.

The best by far is my Sony blu ray player. It seems to have a slightly higher frame rate and resolution that the ps4. Better codec for sure. When the image is static it looks 720P, where the PC looks 480i to me.

National Hockey ,This time, however, something might happen! But probably not. The Canucks are in an odd position where they are clearly building for the future, but are also in a fairly solid playoff position now and now is when fans spend money on playoff tickets. On the other hand, teams are paying exorbitant prices for merely okay players, so it’s tempting to want the Canucks to trade away one of their multitude of middle-six forwards like Chris Higgins, Shawn Matthias, Brad Richardson, or Jannik Hansen to stock up on draft picks and roll the dice that losing one of them won’t cost the Canucks too dearly in the short term. The emergence of Ronalds Kenins and the presence of other solid youth down in Utica make it tempting, but the Canucks also don’t want to raid Utica’s roster too much with the Comets looking to make a push for the Calder Cup and give their prospects some valuable experience.

99,"Tell me stories, graybeards.","I first began watching hockey around the time the Edmonton Oilers were a powerhouse in the mid- to late-80s. Think Mark Messier, Wayne Gretzky, Jari Kurri, Grant Fuhr, and Paul Coffey. It was depressing to see my Red Wings lose to them in the conference finals two years in a row, but I look back and remember those hockey games fondly. Guys like Steve Yzerman, Gerard Gallant, Petr Klima, Shawn Burr, Adam Oates, Bob Probert, and Joe Kocur. Good games, even better fights.

So anyway, I'm hoping that some /r/nhl old farts (like me) could tell some stories from that era, or even earlier eras (like when the Islanders were dominant in the early 80s, or the Canadiens were dominant in the late 70s). 

As I recall, there were more goals, more breakaways, and more fights. (And it was more fun to watch...)

348,There are many lists out there tanking NHL logos from worst to best. There's a lot on which they disagree. Care to help me determine which logos reddit thinks are the best?,"First and foremost, I understand that logos change over the years and many teams have multiple logos.  We will be looking only at the primary logos for the 2014-2015 season as they appear on the NHL website.  Here's a link with all of them: http://www.nhl.com/ice/teams.htm?navid=nav-tms-main

Here's my proposed process: Each respondent will rank each logo from best to worst by division, so each person will generate four lists.  Teams will get one point for best logo in the division, two points for second best, etc.  The two teams in each division with the best average score will advance to our final round.  We'll repeat the process with those top eight teams in the finals.  If people want to go further and get an even more detailed list, we can divide the remaining 22 teams into divisions as well and repeat the process (ex: ranking logos 9-19 and logos 20-30 in their own separate consolation rounds).

If you wish to be a part of the process, please provide your four divisional rankings below so we can get started.  A simple numbered list is sufficient, with 1 being the best in your opinion and 7 or 8 (depending on division) as the worst.  Eastern Conference teams ranked as eighth in their respective divisions will also receive seven points so they don't get screwed simply for being in a larger division.  I will show my list as an example and to get things started.

Here are some guidelines for anyone who is interested:
-These lists are subjective and different people will have different criteria for what constitutes a “good” logo.  Some may prefer classic looks, some may prefer new school.  Some may like simplicity, some may like intricacy.  That's the whole point.  You create your own criteria for what a “good” logo is.
-When stuck between two teams consider this: if you were on a hockey team, which logo would you rather have on your jersey?
-TRY TO KEEP FAN BIASES OUT OF THIS.  I know this is easier said than done, but try to eliminate as much of that bias as you can.  This is meant to find reddit's favorite LOGO, not favorite TEAM.
-Similarly, don't judge a logo by who wears it.  Don't dock the Penguins because you think Crosby is a whiner and don't boost the Canadiens because Manny Malhotra is the best name in the league.

I'd obviously like to get as many respondents as possible because I'd like the list to be as accurate as possible.  It also gives me an excuse to mess around with spreadsheets.  Thank you and happy ranking!",nhl,1427469424,Teslas_Apprentice,12,3,True,2015-03-27

390,"New to the sport, me and my pal want to jump in! Where do we start?","Me and my best friend are college students who just really discovered how awesome hockey really is. It came after my buddy bought an old nhl game while we were on spring break and we got hooked playing the game. 

It since has progressed to us scheduling our days to watch the college tournament and finding ourselves watching other NHL games as well. 

We're roommates and have been bestfriends since elementary school so we naturally want to find a team to rally behind. We realize we're jumping in late this season but still nonetheless want to get involved. 

So, to start a debate I suppose I'd like to ask you which team we should rally behind. We do not know too much history other than the Canadiens are the Yankees, the Red Wings are the Redsox, and the Flyers are the Cubs. 

We also live in the middle of the US (Kentucky) so geographically we don't really care where they are.

We also would like to find out more ways to dive into the sport other than watching the college tournament and playing Playstation.

39,Gamecenter functionality,"I'm wondering, how many of you guys out there with a Gamecenter subscription are running into problems trying to use it. 

Personally, I've had the service for like three or four seasons now, and can't remember it ever being so dysfunctional. It basically doesn't work a good 50% of the time.

Due to my work schedule, I have to watch the games later in the evening after they've already concluded. We are talking 2-3am here, when you'd figure the traffic on their networks would be lower. 

The constant playback and buffering issues make watching a game a real test of will. It will play three or four seconds, then stop to buffer, then play a few more, and so on. 

This happens across multiple viewing platforms. Typically try with the ps4 first, then jump to the pc if the ps4 isn't working. If the ps4 is not working though, the pc won't be much better. In fact I'd argue it is worse, since when it is buffering, it skips forward in the game. It has the freaking time bar displayed at all times as well. Who wants to see the time bar down at the bottom all the time? It's stupid, because on the off chance the service is working as intended, then (as an example) when I am watching in the third period and see that there's still another half hour to the game, I know there is going to be OT. 

And to top it all off, when you contact their support, they just copy and paste some pre written generic response and email it back to you. When you press the issue and an actual person responds, they are rude, and dismissive, and nothing gets any better. 

I'm certain that my internet service is not the issue. I've got a 100mb connection, I can use other streaming services with no issue at all. I mean, we can have Netflix on in hd on at least two tvs at the same time and it's no problem...but streaming NHL Gamecenter, even at the lowest settings doesn't work? 

If this is not just some weird isolated problem, I'd like to hear about it. The NHL, or whoever is actually behind Gamecenter, is saying it is just me. ",nhl,1423038194,[deleted],6,1,True,2015-02-04

As of right now there is little doubt that within the next 5 years, there is either going to be relocation or expansion and Vegas and Seattle seems to be at the top of the list, despite Portland having a perfectly fine stadium (something Seattle is sorely missing), proven to have a dedicated fan base (Something Vegas has simply not) and a potential owner in Paul Allen.

I think I could appreciate the game a lot more if I had a team to follow. I admittedly know little about the NHL today; hopefully you guys can help me out and help match me to a team. 
The biggest condition for this team is that they don't go out and buy all the top free-agents (think Yankees or Dodgers) in order to win. I think establishing the players you have in house is important. Don't get me wrong, free-agents aren't completely taboo. I just believe in long term success by developing talent, not buying wins. I'd like for my team to be at least moderately successful. I know this may sound shallow, but guys, I'm from Kansas City. I've grown up cheering for perennial losers (though we've had some recent success). I can't deal with putting my heart into another team that loses year in, year out.
I value stable and well-respected ownership/management. I don't want to be cheering for the team that the rest of the league hates either. Geography isn't too important, but I'd like to cheer for an American team.

270,"Is your goalie better when the pressure is on, or off? Are they sloppy when they have the lead? A look at the differences in 5 on 5 save % in different situations. (xpost /r/hockey)","Browsing through [Puckalytics](http://www.puckalytics.com/goaliestats.html) goalie stats recently, I've started to become really interested in performance of goalies in different situations. In particular, I was interested in seeing how performance changed from ""close situations"" (which Puckalytics defines as a 1 goal difference in the first and second periods and/or a tie in the third) to situations where one team had a big lead or deficit. By determining the differences between the 3 stats, we could paint a rough picture of which goalies play better when the pressure is on vs off, as well as gain insights into pretty specific situations.

First as a baseline, lets look at save percentages in 5v5 close situations. We use close situations as the baseline primarily because each team should be playing a relatively balanced play style. I.e., when you have a big lead your team will probably play a more defensive style, which you would normally expect to lead to a higher save %. Likewise, when you are losing your team may be more aggressive, which can lead to more breakaways and rebounds and an overall lower save % for the goalie. 5 on 5 close helps to mitigate the differences in strategy for those situations.

For the data set, goalies had to have a minimum of 500 minutes ice time where they played in close situations. 

[Looking at the baseline graph, we don't see many surprises.](http://i.imgur.com/t7e4CDZ.png) Perhaps the biggest surprise is that Carey Price isn't in the top 5, but we can attribute this to the fact that he is stupidly consistent in pretty much all situations (i.e. top % in winning/losing situations, decent PP save% etc). Pekka and Craig Anderson on the other hand, seem to be especially good at full strength and when the game is on the line. Of course some of this can be attributed to the way defenses play and their overall talent level as well, but this still paints a pretty good picture.

Now on to the really interesting part (imo). How does their close game play compare to their play when the game is starting to get out of reach? To visualize this, I collected data for save % in losing and winning situations when the margin was 2 goals or more, then I subtracted the close game save % from those results. Then I plotted the differences as x,y coordinates on a plane. 

Let's look at Pekka for example. For the Y coordinate point I take 92.59% (Losing by 2) subtract 95.38% (close game) and get -2.99% (so Pekka is nearly 3 percent worse when the Predators are losing and playing aggressive than when the game is close). Then for the X coordinate I plot the difference between winning by 2 save % and close save %, which is -2.79%, so Pekka's plot on the graph becomes (-2.79,-2.99).

**So what does it all mean?**

Well, we can loosely infer a few things from this. I wouldn't go so far as making snap judgments about every player based on it, but I do still think a lot of it is interesting. Let's run through the quadrants...

* **The expected.** With the exception of outliers like Lundqvist and Miller, this is what you would expect to see given the situation. As we noted earlier team with the lead *should* lead to a better % for the goalie, while a team trailing will usually lead to a worse %. 

 * Miller and Lundqvist are interesting. Do they get frustrated because they keep letting shots through, making them play worse? Do their teams get too aggressive offensively leading to breakaways? A combination of both? I don't watch the Canucks or Rangers enough to comment but would be interested to hear opinions.

* **The not so clutch.** These goalies seem to play consistently better when the game is out of reach in one way or another. Is it because they tense up under pressure when the game is close and don't play as well? Or--with players who have a high save % when losing--is it because they try and put the game on their shoulders and save the team?

* **The sloppy.** These goalies tend to have a the best save percentage only when the game is on the line. Honestly, for most of them I wouldn't make too big of a deal about it, because most of them are not that much worse when winning and know to step up in the right situation. 

 * Jake Allen, however is getting pretty dangerously sloppy. Admittedly it's a lower sample size (just about 50 shots on goal) because the Blues aren't frequently winning by 2+ when he's on the ice, but it's still enough of a trend that if I were his coach I would definitely point it out to him. He's letting about 1 in every 5 shots through in 5 on 5 hockey when the Blues are winning by 2+, and that's just nuts considering they should be playing more aggressive defensively in that situation.

* **The weird.** These goalies perform better when losing and worse when winning and I don't know what to make of it. Lehtonen is not a big difference, probably just facing aggressive offenses when his team is winning and stepping up when the game is close. Niemi, however seems to really lose interest if his team is winning big, and genuinely starts focusing when his team is losing by 2+. Either that, or San Jose's game plan is just really out of whack (attacking more when winning big, playing more defensively when losing big).

Would be really interested in hearing /r/NHL's thoughts on all this. Let me know if you have any questions or see anything flawed with my methodology.

277,Looking for a team to follow,"I've been a huge sports fan my whole life, but I never got too invested in the NHL. I've been casually watching quite a bit this season, and I found myself really enjoying it. I think I could appreciate the game a lot more if I had a team to follow. I admittedly know little about the NHL today; hopefully you guys can help me out and help match me to a team. The biggest condition for this team is that they don't go out and buy all the top free-agents (think Yankees or Dodgers) in order to win. I think establishing the players you have in house is important. Don't get me wrong, free-agents aren't completely taboo. I just believe in long term success by developing talent, not buying wins. I'd like for my team to be at least moderately successful. I know this may sound shallow, but guys, I'm from Kansas City. I've grown up cheering for perennial losers (though we've had some recent success). I can't deal with putting my heart into another team that loses year in, year out. I value stable and well-respected ownership/management. I don't want to be cheering for the team that the rest of the league hates either.

Steve has made tremendous contributions to sport and to the community and is a role model and inspiration for all Canadian athletes.  
  
Some of you, like myself, may even remember watching Steve play in this building for the first time as a member of the Phoenix Suns in 1996. Throughout a tremendous 18-year NBA career, Steve’s achievements both on and off the hardcourt have left a lasting imprint on the game of basketball and on what it means to be a global citizen. We look forward to welcoming and recognizing him for his many contributions on March 3rd.  
  
As always, thank you for your passionate support and we look forward to seeing you then.

*Friend: Who are you, Jim Rome?*


**Co-Worker: He is an absolute class act and a true legend.**


*Friend: With a massive gambling addiction*


**Co-Worker: While it's sad to see him go, the Devils were able to get a solid return for him, and hopefully those draft picks pan out to play a role in the team's rebuilding process.** 


*Friend: The Devils did get a lot*


**Co-Worker: I was fortunate enough to meet Jagr on multiple occasions as both a fan and a member of the media, and he was a pleasure to interact with every single time.**


*Friend: “____, when your done working can you bring your camera and take multiple pictures and video of me standing in front of Jagr?”
“Did you get it? did you get it? How many pictures?”*


**Co-Worker: His outlook and approach to the game (and life in general) was always so positive. On top of that, I have never encountered a hockey player with more passion than him.**


*Friend: Get a room*


**Co-Worker: He gave it his all every single time he stepped on the ice, be it a practice, a game, or a late-night skating session with his infamous weighted vest.** 


*Friend: I saw him coast on a shift in 1997. Slacker.*


**Co-Worker: He wore his heart on his sleeve and was a great teammate and veteran presence for younger players to learn from. It's a shame to see some Devils fans turn on him in tough times, but I think most fans realize how lucky they are to have shared even just a short time with one of the game's all-time greats.**

Anyways, the pacific is arguably one of the toughest divisions in hockey, but the Sens have found a way to conquer it. The Sens hold an impressive 8-2-1 record against pacific opponents this year. The most recent battles lead to back-to-back shutouts for journeymen goalie Andrew Hammond.

It is even more impressive that the sens are doing this with one of the youngest teams in the NHL, as well as being one of the ""basement"" salary cap teams.

Why doesn't NHL go with the 3-2-1 point format that was evident in the WJHC this past year? 3 points goes to the regulation winner, 2 for OT winner and 1 for OT loser. This way, there's incentive to win in regulation also those wins are worth more.

Similarly , bad defensive teams are going to take a lot of penalties. So no surprise, Dallas is high in PP ops -- pretty good offensively with the scoring leader, but also pretty high in penalties as not so great defense.

110,Hockey has the most inconsistent enforcement of rules,"It boggles my mind that a professional organization can be so inconsistent in the way it officiates the game. Three major examples:
1. After play is whistled dead in front of a goalie's net there is immediate pushing, face washing, crosschecks, etc. If a call is made, it is usually the player who retaliates (in fact, this notion is constantly echoed by announcers). All this does is increase player tension and slow the game. If they really wanted to address fighting without eliminating it, this would be a good start.
2. There is a different standard depending on circumstances. Calls are less likely during penalty kills, end of the game, overtime, and playoffs. 
3. Why is blood a determining factor in whether high sticking penalties are minors or double minors? Getting hit in the face/head sucks regardless of whether you get cut.

Allow me to explain. I am a ducks fan and I will say Brian Hayward and John Ahlers don't play favorites. They do call bs on the ducks and don't try to idolize their fuck ups. Dirty are announcers that like to push the idea that their team is flawless even when they play dirty and when bs calls are made for their team they actively cheer. 

John Ahlers always makes a point of saying things along the lines of ""That's just how it is going to be."" They call referee bullshit even when it benefits the club. That being said some announcers tend to praise the terrible calls as good calls. 

So give me your opinions on these announcers either their faults or great work. It's hard to experience all of the announcers because we all have our own teams so try to see the bull they spew sometimes. ",nhl,1420804041,CarpeDiem96,11,1,True,2015-01-09

For any Winnipeg Jets home games, during intermissions and during normal commercials, Rogers/NHL GCL blacks out commercials (Only for TSN as far as i'm aware). Whenever this happens, the volume changes from 100 to 0, and doesn't correct itself when the game resumes.

Where I have this setup to a TV streaming from a mac mini, each time commercials come on, I need to grab my phone, open up a remote control app, and change the volume back up, only to have it go back to 0 next time commercials come on or there is another intermission.

This *only* happens on TSN where they black out commercials. Does not do this for fox sports (though I wish that would be blacked out during commercials), Rogers, CBC, or any other possible broadcaster.

217,How would you turn the Arizona Coyotes franchise around?,"Trading Dubnyk recently made me think about the potential reasons and I could only think of a couple. Maybe it was to free up some salary so they can make a real offer to someone and boost their offense. Maybe it was to boost Mike Smith's confidence as he will once again be the main goaltender. He apparently was ecstatic about the trade, as shitty as that sounds. Or maybe they knew nobody would want Mike Smith in his current condition so they tried to get something for someone before the draft.

The Coyotes constantly try to pull people up from the minors in hopes that they will be a star. At this point it's like watching someone with a gambling addiction continuously fail.

They have positioned themselves somewhat decently this year for the draft at least.

But it always says that the game isn't ready yet to watch - usually it takes about 4 hours for the game to be available.  (The actual message is ""Please wait for the replay... This game has ended.  An archived version will be available soon.)

Funny thing is, if I turn the game on while the game is still live, I can rewind to the beginning and watch the whole thing.  But as soon as the game is over, I can't access the game until several hours later.  Also interesting: this problem does not show up when watching the game on my computer.

Players don't play or compete for the conference championship (well they do but it's not the goal). You see it when most teams don't even touch and look at the trophy. It's just another stepping stone closer to the final.
So wouldn't a final 4 seated bracket work? The remaining two teams from each conference are ranked based on regular season standings and they flip conferences. 1st east plays 2nd west, 1st west plays 2nd east. How many times have you watched a conference final and thought that the two teams playing were the best 2 in the NHL and they should rightfully so play for the championship.

These are just my own personal opinions. I've played hockey all my life (mostly goalie) and I'm not satisfied with the current rules. Here are changes I'd like to see made (could probably think of more). These are listed in order of preference/importance (more or less), but they're all important to me in some way. Please upvote or downvote the specific changes in the comments; feel free to comment on them

a.   Nets are adjustable and sized to the goalies height/weight proportion.

b.   Players will use wooden sticks and helmets with face grids. 

c.   Females allowed to play with males. 

d.   No more power plays. Receiving a penalty will eject you from the game for 20 minutes. 2nd offense or unsportsmanlike penalty will eject you from the game. Fighting will eject you from the season and playoffs. Reason - this game is about perfection, sportsmanship, and elegance, not the opposite. Extreme cases of 'intent to injure' will ban you from the nhl and reduce the allotted roster by 1 until the season or playoffs is over. The fundamental rules concerning violence that we played under as kids should not differ from the adult rules, else a bad message is sent.

e.   Goalies have option of wearing two blockers

f.   A win = 3 points, OT win = 2 points, shootout win = 1 point, loss = 0 points

g.   Goalie is allowed to play the puck anywhere 

h.    Crease rules: No opposing player is allowed to skate in the goalie crease. Defending players that push opposing players into crease will receive a penalty. Goalies cannot be touched in any way while in crease. Puck in crease can only be touched if skater is outside crease

i. backup goalie must play at least 20 cumulative minutes per game (if physically able). 

j.    overtime is extended to 20 minutes

k.   All skaters shoot once in shootout.  Best score wins. Tie breakers settled by a suicide race between 2 skaters.

l. all players will receive a beer after the game. drinking is optional but recommended. jk :)

2a. all NHL officals: player and non-player salaries to be cut to 300k max annually. Excess funds to be diverted to education, medicine, research, charity, and other societal support structures. (yeah right)

2b. Season reduced to 58 games.  Divisons and conferences dissolved. Each team has a home and away game against every team.

3a. The team that improved the most (comparing the first half of season to second half) gets to play a single elimination post-season game for the 16th seed. To qualify, the team must rank 17 or below and not have any fighting or 'intent to injure"" penalties (sportsman-like). This is highly subject to change, and I mostly just want to see a team rewarded for improving (which should be more important than winning at any level).

459,The Southern Conspiracy,"Before we start I would like to first say this is not a theory I believe, but also not outside the realm of possibility either. 
Just something I thought deserves more discussion than ""the NHL hates my Canadian team and loves your American team"" accusations commonly littered over sports news websites.        

 

So here is my take on this theory,  based solely on the complaints I've heard both on the net and Irl:

The majority of American hockey fans, despite having a storied history with the game are quite fickle. So in order to keep the game profitable in its biggest markets the league ""favours"" those markets subtlety in the games gray areas such as reffing and hearings and whatever other areas thing might go unnoticed. 
From where Bettmen and the owners sit, this actually makes a lot of sense.  Revenue sharing should keep most other teams out of the red,  as long as they are dominating their largest markets. 
    
 

On another note,  it is a possibility that the NHL is not favouring certain teams,  but is showing bias against certain teams because the market permits it.  Most Canadian markets are like a magic never ending river of cash. Edmonton and Toronto of course are huge examples of how a business could model around delivering a unsatisfactory product for years and still remain profitable.  If the NHL were intentionally sabotaging Canadian teams,  from a financial standpoint it hardly matter to them in the slightest,  especially in contrast to the financial issues facing teams like Arizona and Florida. 
    
 

The last argument I'll present for this theory is Gary man with a plan Bettmem.  He is the one reason this doesn't seems as far fetched as perhaps it should.  His reputation is of one who is willing to sacrifice the integrity of the sport for a increase in profit.  If we were to look at the history of his tenure,  I'm sure we would find a ton of evidence to support this,  but I'm going to focus on a more current topic.  The World Cup of hockey.    
    
 

The ""world cup""  of hockey is actually a concept I support. It's announced format is nothing more than a shortsighted business tactic designed to put pressure on the Olympics.
If the NHL prioritized the growth of the sport,  and quality competition it would have instead come out and announced a qualifying tournament to take place at some point in the next few years.  Instead we get teams being thrown together to best make use of NHL assets so the tournament can be held locally, on the cheap.   The NHL has stated it plans on transforming this into a dignified event with qualifiers for other countries and all but as we all know,  they must host this half baked tournament ASAP so they can gain leverage in the argument to keep NHL players out of the  Koran Winter Olympics.  So yes, again, the business over integrity model definitely fits with the theory above and could be a factor in swaying some opinions toward that line of thinking.    
    
 

The only big implausibility I can see is the NHL's history of leaked informatiom. Some of these incidents are intentional and calculated,  other times something may just happen to slip through the cracks. 
A conspiracy of this scale would likely require cooperation from more than a few individuals. Refs, owners and people in the department of player safety immediately come to mind. 
If any one individual were to disagree with this approach (like say the owner of a struggling Canadian franchise) it would be as simple as an anonymous leak to the media... Or Bob Mackenzie to cause a huge stir. The rate at watch information is leaked in the NHL it would be extremely shocking to find out something like this has been going on under our noses.    
    
 

Would Bettmen and Co really take this kind of risk? My gut is leaning toward no,  but like I said it's not impossible.  The argument though is deffs a bit Shaky. Unless something comes to light in the future all we can do is keep guessing.  ",nhl,1422482656,Rifick,1,0,True,2015-01-28

That got me wondering if any other small regions or towns had similar claims to fame when it comes to NHL coaches.

Here is a list of where all the head coaches are from:

* Anaheim- Toronto, ON
* Arizona- Moosomin, SK
* Boston- Blind River, ON
* Buffalo- Sault Ste Marie, ON
* Calgary- Hawkesbury, ON
* Carolina- Three Hills, AB
* Chicago- Windsor, ON
* Colorado- QC, QUE
* Columbus- Crystal, MN
* Dallas- Warburg, AB
* Detroit- Manitouwadge, ON
* Edmonton- Dade City, FL
* Florida- Summerside, PEI
* Los Angeles- Viking, AB
* Minnesota- North Bay, ON
* Montreal- Montreal, QC
* Nashville- Franklin, Mass
* New Jersey- Dunnville, ON
* NY Islanders- Cranston, RI
* NY Rangers- QC, QUE
* Ottawa- Charlottetown, PEI
* Philadelphia- Calahoo, AB
* Pittsburgh- Dartmouth, NS
* San Jose- Melville, SK
* St. Louis- Edmonton, AB
* Tampa Bay- Prince Georga, BC
* Toronto- Sudbury, ON
* Vancouver- Climax, SK
* Washington- Winnipeg, MAN
* Winnipeg- Sault Ste Marie, ON

Sault Ste. Marie deserves some recognition for having two coaches from a town of 75,000. That's half the population of PEI. 

The rural area around Edmonton can also claim a  few, and Moosomin, SK is only 160 m from Melville, giving the southeast corner of Saskatchewan two coaches.",nhl,1418075226,OccasionallyWright,1,6,True,2014-12-08

He was undoubtedly the biggest Flyers fan I know. I told his parents that I was still going to attend the game and make a little tribute to Joe while there and his dad decided to send the Flyers an email telling them about Joe. Long story short, the flyers sent two Tshirts to my apartment as well as put us on TV while Keith Jones said some nice words about Joe. We both moved out to California from Delaware about a year ago so it was our first Flyers game in LA. I am a little ticked off at the Staples center because they said my poster was too big; the poster my wife and I spent hours making. She cried when they made us throw it away.

If a player is in the penalty box for whatever reason, and his penalty expires at such a time that if he were to enter the ice and make a play, it would be considered too many men on the ice.  For example, during off-setting minors, when five skaters continue to play, or off-setting fighting majors, or when the box has several players, and a team is going to be short two men for an extended period of time.  

Does that play have to remain in the box until a stoppage, or is he allowed to skate across the ice to his bench?  I'm thinking the former, but rule 74 didn't seem to clear it up for me.",nhl,1415554387,onzie9,3,0,True,2014-11-09

195,[iOS] NHL gamecenter app. Avoid local blackouts without VPN/DNS.,"So this may have been posted before, if it had I am sorry. I just found an app that will let you bypass local blackouts in the gamecenter app on Apple devices.

This DOES require a jailbreak. I found an app in Cydia called ""LocationFaker8"" which costs $2.99 (there are probably free alternatives, but as this is built for iOS 8 I felt the $2.99 was justified). It was designed to fake your location for things like the camera app, but it works with gamecenter! The app is just a map with a marker. Drag it to somewhere that isn't local to you, and flip the on switch. No more blackouts. No more VPNs.


If you aren't jailbroken you should do it soon. There is a working untethered jailbreak for iOS 8.1, but the 8.1.1 patch from Apple is coming soon and will break the jailbreak for an unknown period of time. If you want to jailbreak, update to 8.1 NOW and avoid the 8.1.1 patch when it is released. I'd suggest checking out the jailbreak sub for more info. /r/jailbreak/

198,ELI5: Too many men on the ice during tonight's overtime between NYR vs PIT?,"During tonight's (Nov 15) game between the NY Rangers and Pittsburgh Penguins, the game went into overtime. In overtime, the teams were skating 4 on 4 and a penalty was called on each team, thus forcing a 3 on 3. Then, a penalty was called on the Penguins, which made the game a 4 on 3. This makes sense since you can't have less than 3 skaters per side. While skating 4 on 3, the original penalty expired which added an extra man per side: 5 on 4. Wouldn't this situation technically be ""too many men on the ice"" since in overtime it is supposed to be 4 on 4? After a breakaway attempt by Pittsburgh right when the penalty expired, the returned the teams to 4 on 3.

So, why wasn't it too many men, and when are the refs supposed to remove the extra players to restore the 4 on 3? The TV announcers did not address this detail.",nhl,1416107711,hclear,3,2,True,2014-11-15

I think the NHL is now the best option for Omaha, pending that KC does not work out. First of all, not only does the University of Nebraska-Omaha have massive success selling tickets first at the civic auditorium and now the nearly 19,000 seat CenturyLink Center. Omaha also has supported one of the best junior league franchises in the Omaha Lancers, among local teams including the Tri-Cities Storm, the Lincoln Stars (considered the best fan base in the USHL).

i asked this question to unblock-us and got this reply..

That is very true. NHL can surely trace your real location. Our DNS service can only unblock the contents that you don't normally have access specially for the blackout games.

Now, when it comes to the devices that can tell your real location such as Smart Phones and Tablets then that's where we always recommend that you turn off location services to not let them track you.

With that having said, the use of our service is always your option. Its up to you if you want to go legal wherein you get the service from NHL itself and not use any unblocking services and dead with the blackouts.

Or you can use our DNS service to achieve an unblocked experience with some bits of risks. Your choice is something we don't have control over as by the end of the day, its your choice that always matter. Let me know if you need further assistance.

He's almost impossible to get mad and acts as a guide for Orson (the main pig) when dealing with his three older brothers. He spent a lot of time arguing with his twin sister Lanolin.

I live in Kansas City (and am stoked to be going to the Blues game here tomorrow) and the talk of an expansion get me excited about a team coming here. Of course, this will just end in disappointment but here are my completely biased thoughts of some of the cities that are being discussed for an expansion. Was wondering what everyone else thought:

Seattle - Don't know much about the hockey scene there but couldn't imagine it being too great and any hockey fans there now I would assume have adopted Vancouver as their team. Although I guess Vancouver is a great team to jump ship from but don't see it being a big hockey market.

Toronto Part II - Hockey is HUGE is Toronto, which is why everyone is already a die hard Leafs fan. Anyone in Toronto who is not a Leafs fan I would assume has latched on to another team already making a new team in Toronto tough to have a fan base.

Las Vegas - Huge gimmick. Already know their name would be the Gamblers or something along those lines. They may do well financially but won't have much of a solid fan base. I accredit that to the population in LV being a good amount of tourist who will just go to a game (or not) when they are there. If only there was another team in that area that we could compare them to in order to see how they would fare...see, Phoenix

Quebec City - crapshoot. could go either way. They have lost a team before but a comparison to Winnipeg could be appropriate and Winnipeg, as I understand, is doing ok for themselves so far.

Kansas City - BOOM! May say that the midwest is not good for hockey and there is no fan base but look in comparison to other similar nearby cities (STL, COL, DAL) who all have a strong fan base. The people in KC could latch on to a team to make their own. The team may initially not fare all that well but will be a huge boost to the sport as it would create an entirely new fan base which will help spread and grow the game. An immediate rivalry will also be born with STL

My friend then called Rogers, who said that you're able to watch NHL games if you are a Rogers cable subscriber and you subscribe to the NHL tv package and you login with your Rogers account. For all other people (non-Rogers customers), they are still not certain on whether they will offer it or not.

So I finally got through to Rogers today, and they said that it would indeed be available for everyone (not just Rogers subscribers), just it is taking some time to roll out the platform. It should be up within the next few days.

However, they said the cost of purchasing access for the full season would be $208! Last year purchasing the package through NHL's site, I paid $149.99. So this is a price increase of ~$60!

This should come as no surprise to Canadians. Rogers is absolutely unparalleled in decades of gouging the Canadian consumer, there was no reason to think that this would be any different.

A lot of alternate methods to streaming games were mentioned in my last thread, better start looking into those possibilities, because I'd rather contract Hepatitis than contract with Rogers.",nhl,1409673613,briskt,13,3,True,2014-09-02

First of all, what team should I support? I dont really have any geographical connections to any city apart from Vancouver which I visited a few years ago. Preferably id prefer a team that was roughly middle, or top third of either conference currently or in recent seasons, exciting to watch, and has a really passionate fan base. A good history is a bonus too! I know there's no real answer to this question, but any recommendations you guys could make would be much appreciated.

Secondly, living in Australia is not exactly convenient for watching games. Ive never seen an NHL game aired on free to air tv in aus (thats a thing here im not sure about the US or Canada), and i dont have paid tv or foxtel or anything like that, so thats not an option. Is there a way I can watch full games online or anything? I also saw the NHL has a paid service for that sort of thing, is it worth it?

183,After 43 years of hockey the Islanders have decided that the true fans aren't allowed at the home opener or season closer.,"To anyone here who understands the feeling of having your beloved sports franchise be gutted and moved. For years my family supported the Islanders through some of the worst hockey to be displayed, probably ever. We'd buy tickets to the first and last game of the year and watch it as a family. These are treasured memories of mine, and something I couldn't put a price on. I'm not a rich man, but it meant a lot to me to see my beloved team play its last season in the stadium I practically grew up in. I knew the majority of my family wouldn't be interested in most of the games, and I made an attempt to accommodate them into at least the first and last game of the season just to keep our tradition alive for one last time. Since I understood it would be difficult to rearrange tickets in a way that would make it possible for my family to all sit together for any of the games I wanted to share with them, I decided it would be best to substitute those out for other games I could bring friends or family along too that they showed interest in. My plan being to wait in line like I used to so many years ago to purchase tickets when they went on sale to the general public. Well it was then I found out these wouldn't be made available to the general public. Unless you purchase season tickets, you won't be allowed access to the first or last game of the year. Their other plans don't include both, YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE ONE. They've gutted my team, they've moved them out, and mismanaged them in any way they possibly could. Now they have decided that the true fans that have stuck with them through years of horrible hockey, and some of the worst general managing any sport has ever seen, don't matter. Unless of course you buy full season tickets.. I for one have had just about enough of this franchises disrespect to its fans. This is the final insult. I for one will not be buying any tickets for any games the Islanders are in, I'm considering a full boycott of any televised games as well. I can't stand for such an egregious disregard for the true fans of the team, not just some talking wallet.

Two points on this.  From the rulebook: ""61.1 Slashing - Slashing is the act of a player swinging his stick at an opponent, whether contact is made or not. Non-aggressive stick contact to the pant or front of the shin pads, should not be penalized as slashing. </B>Any forceful or powerful chop with the stick on an opponent’s body, the opponent’s stick, or on or near the opponent’s hands that, in the judgment of the Referee, is not an attempt to play the puck, shall be penalized</B> as slashing.""  Bold added by me.  Those folks who claim it to be an automatic penalty should read the f*ing rule they bitch about.  It's not automatic - ""... in the judgment of the Referee ...""

The other point I would like to raise - are they seriously saying that players should be allowed to intentionally break an opponents stick?

For as long as I've really cared who got in on any particular season (and that's quite a few years), there isn't a name on the list I'm not thinking...

""I'd have chosen this guy over that.""

The Dominator. 2 Harts as a goalie, the stats, the way he impacted how kids wanted to play the position, the sheer dominance at times...many times. Crazy.

Modano. All he did was score. One of the best sets of hands ever. So, so fast and smooth sailing in with the puck. Top of the list for US born players but, that statements overshadows him being just one of the best ever. 

Blake. Sure, there's some heat coming from people regarding the big trade but bitterness can never erase what he did on the ice. A big guy who played bigger. Intelligent. Down right nasty when he had to be. Any kid with aspirations of being a great D man should dive into video of this beaut.  

Forsberg. What's to say? Without him the Avs don't have their Cups. A guy everyone loved to watch play even if he was playing against your team. Just plain fun to watch with a highlight reel days long. Such a shame the style of play he chose and, that got so many of us to be fans of his ultimately shut him down too early.

McCreary. If only we had more guys like him wearing the red band. Respected by players, coaches, and fans alike. If he was on your game you knew if he didn't make a call it was because he just couldn't see it. Clone the man.

Mr. Pat Burns. Huge to me personally as a Leafs fan. I still strongly believe this should have been done while he was still with us but, finally, we get to see his likeness added to the Wall. Nobody can dispute his worthiness of being a HhoF member. Just a great coach, plain and simple.  Since his passing I've quietly cursed out the committee for denying him accepting the honor in person. Tonight I'm happy. Mainly because of how his widow, Lynn, was told of the honor by Quinn and Davidson. Choosing to call her rather than letting her just hear it through the media was a great gesture by two classy gents. The emotion in her voice will resonate with me for a while.

256,Simulation Hockey League,"http://theshl.b1.jcink.com/index.php?

Hey everybody, I'm not trying to spam, I'm just posting this site because I thought maybe some of you in this subreddit would be interested in a thing like this. Essentially, you create your own player and embark on your career in the fictional ""Simulation Hockey League"". You'll be drafted to our junior league, the ""Simulation Major Junior Hockey League"" for one season before joining the SHL the following season.

The league functions very much like Be A Pro from the EA NHL Series, except you physically do not play the games, instead they are simulated through the Simon T Hockey Simulator. However, you do train your player and there many ways to do so, none of which are time consuming at all. We have many ""point tasks"" throughout the year, which vary from writing a short like 200 word ""essay"" about how you think your player will do that season to mock drafts to simply posting in a thread and getting points for doing so. On top of that, you can also earn money through your contract you sign with the team, writing articles or creating graphics like avatars or signatures and such. You can then spend that money on individual training and add points to your player on a weekly basis.

In terms of community, we are very active and very welcoming. Immediately, you will be assigned to a member who will act as your sort of mentor and help you acclimate to the site and all of its features. There are also commissioners who are always willing to answer your questions or you do something.

277,"Hypothetically, what would this signed stick be worth? (Story inside).","Back in good old 1967, my Dad, just a young tyke, was at Game 6 of the Stanley Cup Playoffs between the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Montreal Canadiens. Unfortunately for him, he had an appendix attack and had to go to the emergency hospital in the arena. 
While he was down there, a Toronto player (I can't remember who) was there with an injury. This nice player, whoever it was, took pity on my Dad and ended up getting a stick signed by the team. I don't know 100% if it was the whole team or a majority of the players, but there's a good amount of signatures on it. I don't know for sure if it was the game winning stick (I don't think it was), but I don't think that changes the importance too much. Some of the signatures are a tad faded due to the fact that it's been a long time since they've won...

My Dad ended up passing away a few years ago and my brother and I inherited the stick. We're not exactly in the process of selling it, but that doesn't stop our curiosity for wondering how much it might be worth.
If I had to guess, I would also assume that as long as the Leafs keep losing for another 3 years at least, the value would go up? (For the 50th anniversary of the last time they won).
Any help/input would be greatly appreciated.

282,Which Team low in the standings now do you think will rise up as Dominating Underdogs next Season?,"This season, we witnessed Colorado go from the worst team in the West to clinching the powerhouse Central Division, while in the East we saw Columbus prove themselves as a hard-working force and a real agitating threat in the future. 

Now, what about during the 2014-2015 Season? 

Personally, I believe Calgary in the West and perhaps even the Islanders in the East could earn themselves a wildcard spot. 

Calgary turned out to be a tough team to play against by the near end of the season, unfortunately it wasn't enough time for them to climb up in the standings, especially in a dominating division. 

Meanwhile, the Islanders are picking up the missing pieces and are on the verge of a major rebuild.

I've watched plenty of other playoff games this year and every stadium is way louder than the UC.  Every game in Minnesota is rocking for the entire time.  All of the west coast games seem to be electric as well.  Even Madison Square Garden was insane last night.  

The fans at all of these stadiums chant and cheer for most of the game because they're hungry.  Hawks fans have grown spoiled and, perhaps, bored.  It's painful how quiet it gets in there lately.

98,Thoughts on a Las Vegas expansion team,"Las Vegas frequently gets mentioned as a site for an expansion team and I think it makes a lot of sense actually. I think beside Quebec city, it's the best choice, here are my reasons.

1. Population- Las Vegas has a population in the area of 2 million, which is more than the following current NHL cities: San Jose, Columbus, Nashville, and Raleigh. It's also larger than Buffalo and a handful of Canadian cities with teams, but I didn't think it was fair to include them. Las Vegas may not be hockey crazy, but it has the size...twice over in some cases.

2. Location- It has no other professional sports team. Seattle or Portland would have fun rivalries with Vancouver, but there is no competition for the ""hometown team"", which I think is the biggest plus. No other pro team for 300 miles.

3. The team can be a tourist attraction and boost the teams across the league, people shell out $100 for a Cirque or other show so why not 30-40 for hockey? MGM-AEG arena will seat 17,500, be open in 2016, and I could easily see them giving out tickets as player comps or cheap family deals. 40 million people visit each year, so they should have a decent amount of people rooting for the visiting team as well.

The two biggest hurdles I see are no hockey history/few local rinks for youth and keeping the Las Vegas atmosphere NHL friendly.

P.S.- Check out the arena, it looks amazing: http://www.arenalasvegas.com/home.aspx",nhl,1400078705,backtowhereibegan,15,5,True,2014-05-14

I smiled and told her I was in fact a blackhawks fan.

274,The officiating situation has gone too far.,"Can anyone honestly say that the way the referees handled last night's situation  positively?

Prust hits Stepan high and late, taking Stepan out of the game temporarily. No call whatsoever instead of a likely deserved [game misconduct](http://youtu.be/cqDDOQ9qHas). I don't mean to sound like I believe there's some sort of conspiracy here, but the refs are not making themselves look good. This blown call has undeniably altered this series and the rest of the Rangers' playoff run. 

Minutes later a scrum occurs because the rangers are rightfully enraged. Now Carcillo has been a very disciplined player since becoming a New York Ranger. The man [has become a fan favorite](http://nyrangersblog.com/2014-articles/dan-carcillo-deserves-some-creditand-an-apology.html), and that's remembering his past.
I can't find good video of the situation, but the officials [did not handle the scrum well.](https://twitter.com/kfraserthecall/status/469639243543748608) That's from retired ref Kerry Fraser's twitter.
I will not try to defend Carcillo's actions. Abuse of officials is a very serious offense, but the official put himself and Carcillo in a dangerous position by grabbing Carcillo the way he did.

The Rangers lost last night. But they're also the losers in the entire situation. Carcillo has been issued an automatic 10 game suspension (NHL Rule 40.3) and Stepan found out he has a broken jaw this morning and is being operated on. Prust has a phone hearing this afternoon for his hit and will likely be gone 3 games.

The referees caused a situation to go from bad to worse because of the way they handled themselves. They allowed an illegal action to undeniably benefit the perpetrator of the action, the prevention of which is precisely the reason they exist. This sort of thing should not be excusable.

Sudden death overtime in Game 6 the other night, Kings vs Hawks, was the most entertaining 20 minutes of hockey all playoffs. 

You know why?  (other than the fact that both teams were givin' it all) 

It's because there are no commercials in overtime. 

You know what kills entertainment?  Commercials. 

When you go to the movie theater, there's a reason why they don't interrupt your movie with commercials.   

At home you can now watch TV shows - uninterrupted, without commercials. 

Why the fuck can't you watch a period of hockey without commercials? 

Such a waste of time for fans.  Everytime commercials come on I have to go getup and look at whats in my fridge or go for a jog or something.    

What's worse, if you pay hundreds of dollars to actually go see this sport live - you STILL have to wait for the commercials.  And since there's no fridge nearby, you have to sit there like a dumbass.   While someone else makes money of the very event you paid to make happen in the first place.  Absurd!

But even worse yet, is the fact that the players have to wait for this shit too.  Such an immersion breaker, a momentum killer, and distraction for the game.    

It's 2014.  Why the fuck does everyone put up with this. 

Can you imagine how much better hockey would be without commercials?   The game could be done in less than 2 hours and you wouldn't have wasted an hour of your life twiddling thumbs while commercials play.   Not to mention, the quality of the game could be on par with what we saw Wednesday night.

440,NHL hockey outcomes decided by referees?,"I've been watching some hockey of late, and notice that a lot of matches have comments like:


""The refs are putting away their whistles and letting them play""

""Its a non call""

""The refs are not allowing anything by this game""

""They are waiving the icing call""


... and other times where its pretty obvious a penalty or something similar, and they let it slide.


Sometimes one team is down by two goals and the refs give them more leeway to ""get back in the game"" or make incorrect calls and then penalise the other team on a technicality to ""balance the books"".


Most games its either a yes or no thing.  You screw up, you're out, its a penalty or whatever.  Hockey seems completely different.  Can't we all just save the time and decide who should win the cup and leave it at that?  Might save some time and we can go back to doing something useful instead.

Also, if you guys are looking for Playoff tickets check out http://www.ticketcorral.com/?ppcsrc=0015 

I was able to get some B's playoff tickets for less than $100 but they have other tickets for all kind of events.....


The reason I think this is the Bruins year, besides me being a biased fan..... IMO there are not any teams that can match up with the Bruins' depth and physicality. The ability for the Bruins to rotate their 4 lines with confidence allows them to physically break down their opponents. Soderberg has really come into his own over the past few months and is very underrated. Could be the best 3rd line center in the league. If I had to pick an achilles heel for the B's it would be their inexperienced D, namely Bartkowski, Krug, and Miller.

So my question is - what is the problem with these teams? Is it really that no bona fide ""super stars"" want to play up here? I can see that in some cases, but aren't most of those stars Canadian to begin with? Are most of these GM's really too incompetent to build a cup-contending team? Is the attention around the clubs so debilitating that the players can't perform up to their abilities? Meddling ownership?

Maybe it's all of these things combined, or none of these things. Personally, I think Canadian teams probably have a hell of a time convincing free agents to come up here, not necessarily just big names either, but the smaller support-role players needed to build a complete team. But I mean, if that's the case, why bother having teams in Canada in the first place if we're never going to win?

231,How can I watch games legally online?,"Hi all,

I paid for NHL Gamecenter Live but now it seems as if since everyone can supposedly watch games on NBC I cannot see the games live anymore until 48 hours after the game. I don't have TV service at my house and I would like to watch a legitimate feed of the game. To clarify, its also a ""local"" game - I'm a sharks fan who lives in San Diego. Sharks are playing LA, which is about two hours away. throughout the regular season I would be blacked out during these games even before it was being aired on the oh so generous NBC. I cannot log in through NBC Live because they require you to enter your tv service provider account info which I do not have. 

Ideally I would like to watch a recordable/pause-able feed as well since I have my own hockey game tonight halfway through the game. Any advice please? 

I'm trying my best not to complain about all the hoops fans have to jump through,  but this is seriously ridiculous. 

Sorry if something similar has been posted before, but this instance has its own specific circumstances. Thank you in advance.

EDIT: Thank you everybody for your kind help. Here's what I ended up doing: I paid for a VPN service to connect to a server in another country (outside of Canada/US) where nhl gamecenter is not blacked out. works beautifully, they think I'm viewing from South America and I'm able to watch every game and pause/rewind as I please.  If anyone wants to know which service and how much,  PM me. 

For anyone who doesn't know, VPN stands for virtual private network and it uses a different IP address to navigate through the internet.

334,Time for NHL to hand out lengthy suspensions,"The NHL’s player safety department is a joke. The title of the disciplinary institution states that their job is to protect players. Right now, they are the main reason for player injuries. When Shanahan took over things did get better, however not nearly good enough.

The recent incident involving Milan Lucic is very disturbing to me. Rule 21.1 of the NHL rulebook states:
“A match penalty involves the suspension of a player for the balance of the game and the offender shall be ordered to the dressing room immediately. 
A match penalty shall be imposed on any player who deliberately attempts to injure or who deliberately injures an opponent in any manner.”
It is clear that Lucic deliberately targets Danny DeKeyser’s genitals. If this isn’t considered a deliberate attempt to injure, I don’t know what is. As the rule states, this act shall therefor result in a match penalty and a suspension. Instead Lucic receives no penalty, which I’m not going to complain about since I am a referee myself. The fact that he only receives a $5000 fine, when the rule clearly states he shall be suspended for the act is what disturbs me.
I have never heard of an accidental spear. A spear is always deliberate and has to be considered an attempt to injure. Therefor a spear shall always result in a suspension. If the NHL takes player safety seriously and wants to eliminate acts such as spearing from the game, they have to do one simple thing. They have to send a message. They have to hand out a suspension that truly hurts, and have a minimum amount of games for the act. 
My idea is this: If a player spears an opponent the minimum penalty shall be a 20 game suspension. For a repeat offender the minimum should be 30 games. At first you may think I’m being stupid, just hear me out. If players know that a spear will result in a 20 game suspension they won’t do it. Maybe it will feel unfair to the first player to receive this penalty. However it is necessary. Handing out big suspensions will make players think twice before doing stupid things.

359,To All the Non-B-lievers,"Over the past couple months I have been surfing around Reddit and other NHL blogs to see what non-B-liever’s thought of my beloved Bruin’s as they were amidst a 15-game run that landed them with the best record in the NHL. I was thinking, “There is so much to talk about with the Bruins, where will they start.” Possibly they will start by praising the Bruins depth and strength of farm system, after all, two of their top 4 defensemen have been down since the turn of the new year but instead of seeing the crumbling of a defense first team, we saw youngsters such as Dougie, Krug, Miller, and Bart the Polander stepping up their game and keeping the B’s defense just as strong as ever. I mean, sure it hasn’t been all roses for Krug Dougie and Bart, but hell, when it comes to the development of young defensemen in the NHL there is no success greater than failure. Or perhaps I would stumble across an article that talked about the emergence of defensive warrior Johnny “Rocket” Boychuck….. Nope, the only article I stumbled upon about Johnny was how he was a dirty player for trying to “jump” PK Subban. Hmmmm trying to jump PK? I’m pretty sure he was just trying to do PK a favor and show the world that PK doesn’t stand for PussyKunt and get him to fight, but Mr. Subban did his best impression of a turtle and crumbled to the floor like a month old sugar cookie.

I thought to myself, “OK, maybe the NHL does not like the defensive minded Bruins so maybe I can find some positive posts about some of our forwards such as Milan Lucic and Riley Smith…” And you know what, I did find an article about Smith— talking about his “uselessness” since the Olympic break. Yes, I admit his goal scoring might have tailed off a bit but there is more than just one way to measure a players effectiveness on the ice. In the past couple months Bergeron and Marchand’s scoring has shot through the roof… and you want me to believe that it due to the third member of the line being nothing more than a traffic cone? Riley plays hockey the right way, sacrifices his body in the corners to free up pucks for more gifted players like Marchand to bury. Not to mention, it seems like every goal from the point I have seen this season has been aided by Riley planting his ass in front of the net Holmstrom style. Like do these so called hockey experts even watch the games or do they just look at the box score and see Riley has no goals and just base their assessment off of that. Now onto “the most underrated player in the NHL,” Milan Lucic. I put that in quotes because those are not my words praising Milan but rather the words of former teammate and future hall of famer Jaromir Jagr. Instead reading about how great of a teammate this guy is sacrificing his body to make his linemates more productive and coming to teammate’s defense at a moments notice I find posts on r/hockey and r/nhl that are complete circle jerks condemning Looch as the second coming of Matt Cooke. I mean cut the shit, I can only sit back and watch these clowns belittle my team for so long before I lose my mind! I admit his crotchshot on Dekeyser was bullshit, but it is the playoffs and things like that happen all the time. Maybe if players would man up and drop their mittens every once and a while things like this wouldn’t happen… But nope, our B’s are still seen as the villains, meanwhile Orpik is still landing headshots and keeping his gloves sewn to his hands…..
The only fanbase I have been seeing love from is the Blues, but that is no surprise given their captain Mr Backes is the ultimate gamer who will score, assist, check, and beat the piss out of you if you mess with his team.

As for my Favorite Eastern Conference fans:
Penguins: Sucks to suck, time to upgrade from that traffic cone you have between the pipes. I don’t want to hear about how dirty Thornton is because he finally gave Orpik what he had coming. We still owe you one for what you did to Savard… Keep your head on a swivel Syd. And stop bitching about players “roughing you up”, heavy lies the crown and when you play on a team with perennial d-bags like Neal and Orpik you are going to have a target on your back.
Habs: What can I say about you that hasn’t already been said by millions of Bruins fans before me? You sit on your high horse saying everyone else is cheap and cheaters meanwhile your players go down easier than a French-Canadian hooker. Don’t get me wrong, I am rooting heavily for you guys against the Lightning because I cant wait to see the Bruins beat the shit out of you and watch you and your coaches and your players cry to officials and try to draw penalties and poke the bear and then skate away from contact father than Rocket Richard on a breakaway. Your days are numbered as self proclaimed hockey royalty…. ICE UP BITCHES

For my Birthday I was given a bit of money I wanted to put towards an NHL Jersey.
To my surprise tonight I found the Sharks NHL Authentic Jerseys on sale for a staggering $160 ( Normally $340 ).

I figured it's time to buy a jersey and was excited to get one, however upon entering the checkout It alerted me with a ' You must have a US Address ' ( I'm Canadian ).

The Canadian Site has the same jersey for $380.

This may be a huge favour to ask of a fellow NHL Redditor but I was wondering if there's anyone out there in the US who'd be willing to help me get this jersey.

It would mean I'd have to ship it to you and ask you to ship it to me in Canada ( Probably would cost approx $20-$30 ).

I figured since I'd be saving so much money I'd want to somehow give you a bonus, so I'd be happy to pay you a very big Tip for doing all of this.

If anyone would be interested please let me know. I want to make it worth your time and while.

TLDR; Need a Jersey shipped from NHL.com to US Address , then posted to Canada, Will Tip Big.

He screams his heart out and runs around the house every time his Capitals score.  Needless to say he loves Ovechkin and wishes to one day get to meet him.  His insanity towards the game is so intense that it cost me my 50 inch flat screen TV when he was pretending to be the Great 8 and hit a puck thru the screen.  My oldest is a Blackhawks fan and constantly messes with his brother that Patrick Kane is better than Ovechkin.  My youngest son just goes against their brothers and cheers for the Penguins and the Red Wings.  
We are moving to Texas in May and they requested to see if I could take them to the game on April 11, Capitals vs Blackhawks.  However, they requested if I could buy Front row seats next to the glass so they could be right in the action.  Luckily I have been able to take them to a few games while we have been up here.  However, I would love to be able to get this for them.  
I have searched several ticket agencies but the handful I have found cost from $550 to $650 each.  Would anyone have or know someone that has front row seats for this game and were not going to use them.  Moreover, that can afford to sell them at a more reasonable price?  Please let me know.

As a Bruins fan , i think getting Iginla on the Lucic-Kreijci line could play a major role in Lucic taking that next step and becoming a top forward in the NHL when he hits his prime, and we can only dream that he approaches the level of Iginla in his own prime.

You can see a lot of things in these two photos, and some stuff you cannot.  This is his basement, and I won't tell you where he lives because you hooligans will steal all of his goodies (and i can't blame you.)  The two stadium seats are from the old Spectrum when they shut it down & before they destroyed it, he purchased two and bolted them down in the man cave.  He has plenty of signed memorabilia, collectable bobbleheads, cards, and even (not in pictures) a goalie stick used in warm-ups.. from Niitymaki, if I remember correctly.  He also has his press passes when he owned a site that he made in the early 2000's (www.flyerflies.com) It has since shut down, just recently actually, but it gained him a little reputation and he was able to be in the press box with JJ, Jonesy, Gary Dornhoffer, Al Morganti, Bill Clement, among many other Philly sports aficionados .  He also used to do post-game interviews around the locker-room area, and had the extreme pleasure of meeting and chatting with plenty of Flyers players; most notably Peter Forsberg.  Like stated before, my brother is the ultimate fan.. and I am eager to know if any of you give him a run for his money.

301,"Head Coach Dan Bylsma: USA Olympic Coach, Stanley Cup Winner, Jack Adams Winner, First 200 wins in fewest games...Should he be fired?","Dan Bylsma has quite a resume. He took over the Pens mid-season 2009 from Michel Therrien and finished the season raising the coveted Stanley Cup. Since then the Pens have been a dominant regular season force, regularly competing for the Presidents Trophy. After a year with out Sidney Crosby, Bylsma won the Jack Adams for his ability to compete for the Presidents trophy whilst battling a slew of injuries and adversity all season long. The Penguins have made the playoffs every season while under Bylsma's command, but that's as far as it goes.

1st Round Playoff losses have been the ending points of Bylsma's seasons since winning the Cup, with the exception of last seasons brutal sweeping by the Bruins in the Eastern Conference final. All of the losses have been embarrassing; from losing to an 8th seeded opponent in a huge upset, to the highest scoring series is recent memory against Philly, and finally the brutal sweeping by the Bruins where the Pens managed 2 goals in 4 games.

As a Pens fan, and in as an /r/penguins community, the general concensus this season and last post season is that Bylsma is brutally stubborn when it comes to his line combinations and strategies. The misuse of Iginla last postseason along with his apparent inability to make in-game adjustments to strategy has earned him quite a few negative comments this season and it seems the Penguins community is asking, ""is this it for Bylsma?""

We all know the old adage, ""the grass is always greener on the other side"", so please offer us Pens fans some insight. 

* I know you all love to hate Pittsburgh, but how would you feel with Bylsma as your coach? 

* Who do you think could coach the Pens better?

* What general strategy should the Pens play based on their roster? (2-way, Transition, Defensive, Grinding, etc.)

* Should Bylsma stay or go?

Recent articles have even touched on dismissing Bylsma before the start of the post season, but it seems there are as many arguements to keep him as there are to can him. What's your opinion.

When I hear clips of US local broadcasts, I often cringe at what I hear - the overhype of every move and hit, the screaming, the hyperbole, etc. I find it almost unwatchable. 

My question is - don't Americans like their sports to carry a little gravitas - think about an NFL broadcast, or baseball. Sure, broadcasters use some humour, but they take it seriously. They respect the sport and the viewers. 

Hockey announcers? To my ears, they are a cross between the PA guy at the demolition derby and an infomercial shill.

First round:

Seeds 1-4 get a bye to the next round

6. Switzerland vs 11. Latvia (Swiss probably to win)
7. Czech Republic vs 10. Slovakia (coin toss who wins)

2nd round

2. USA vs winner of 7vs10--Czech/Slovakia (Doesn't really matter who wins between Czech vs Slovakia bcuz USA will probably beat them both... USA already beat Slovakia 7-1 in round robin and USA beat Russia too, I will take USA over Czechs bcuz Czechs do have firepower but so does USA, so it comes down to goalies. Czechs only have Pavelec as their goalie, so Pavelec vs Quick... USA to win)

3. Canada vs winner of 6vs11--Swiss (Canada to win, however this will be a tougher win than casual fans will realize. Canada is having scoring problems so far and Swiss beat Czechs 1-0 in round robin. Hiller has only allowed 1 goal all tournament so far. And that was a 1-0 loss to Sweden. Yes thats right, the Swiss went 2-1-0 in round robin play with only 1 GA... Canada to win bcuz we just have too much firepower and heart, but like I said, a tough win)

4. Finland vs winner of 5vs12--Russia (coin toss who wins, Finland has won more medals than any other nation since 98 (1silver 3bronze) and has Tuuka Rask in net, Russia has more offensive firepower and home ice advantage but has streaky goalies (Varlamov or Bobrovsky) in net... Coin toss who wins...)

The tournament then goes to a 1st vs 4th, 2nd vs 3rd format... winners go to gold medal game, losers play for the bronze

USA already beat Slovakia 7-1 in round robin and USA beat Russia too, I will take USA over Czechs bcuz Czechs do have firepower but so does USA, so it comes down to goalies. Czechs only have Pavelec as their goalie, so Pavelec vs Quick... USA to win)

3. Canada vs winner of 6vs11--Swiss (Canada to win, however this will be a tougher win than casual fans will realize. Canada is having scoring problems so far (by Canadian standards) and Swiss beat Czechs 1-0 in round robin. And their only loss was 1-0 defeat to Sweden.  Yes thats right, the Swiss went 2-1-0 in round robin play with only 1 GA the whole tourny so far... Hiller did not allow a single goal all tournament and the one goal that was allowed, was scored on their backup Reto Berra.  So not only do the Swiss have a hot goalie, they play extremely well defensively...  So like I said, combine Canada's tough scoring luck vs a tight Swiss defence...  Canada to win this one still bcuz they just have too much firepower and heart, but like I said, a tough win for Canada)

4. Finland vs winner of 5vs12--Russia (coin toss who wins, Finland has won more medals than any other nation since 98 (1silver 3bronze) and has Tuuka Rask in net, Russia has more offensive firepower and home ice advantage but has streaky goalies (Varlamov or Bobrovsky) in net... Coin toss who wins...)

The tournament then goes to a 1st vs 4th, 2nd vs 3rd format... winners go to gold medal game, losers play for the bronze

....And Armageddon is upon us.......

1. Sweden vs the winner of Finland vs Russia

2. USA vs 3. Canada

Anybody's guess from there...?",nhl,1392684079,dilly-o,4,3,True,2014-02-17
157,Please help me identify the signatures on this hockey stick so I can give it to a deserving family (x-post r/BostonBruins),"Hi everyone.  I am in need of some help identifying signatures on a hockey stick I won at a raffle about 15 years ago when I was a kid.  Back around 1999 or 2000, I won an autographed Bruins stick at a charity raffle in my town.  The stick was signed by 17 different players but I don’t know whose signatures they are.

The reason I am l looking to identify the players 15 years later is I would like to give the stick to a kid (not really a kid, he is actually in his mid-20s) in my hometown who is fighting ALS.  I don’t know the kid but I do know his family and my brothers and I were in high school the same time as him and his siblings.  I know that this family would appreciate the stick way more than I ever will, and though I know it won’t change anything, I would really like to do something nice for a family that is in a shitty situation.

Thanks for any help you can give me and if this is inappropriate to post here let know and I will remove it.  Also, if anyone knows of another sub that might be able to help, I would love to post there too.  I will be cross-posting to /r/BostonBruins.

Edited to add the album link, cause I am a dumbass and left it out the first time. 

Edit:

I just want to thank everyone who has helped so far!  I have 16 out of 19 players identified so far, way more then I thought I would get.  I even figured out a few on my own :)  I've been surprised at some of the names on here, I always kind of assumed the stick was signed by a whole bunch of people I had never heard of before, but I actually know who most of the players are, not just Ray Bourque. I can't even begin to express how grateful and appreciative I am of everyone for helping.  Thanks again!!

In the order they appear on the stick:

* 19 Rob DiMaio

* 23 Steve Heinze

They are pretty much all at a 2nd line skill level in the NHL, yet Canada barely beat them in overtime.

195,Writing Opportunity,"The website I run is looking for new writers for each and every team. There are only a few rules that you would have to follow, and I would go into detail of what those are if you're interested. There's no real writing requirement as far as how many articles you have to publish per week (in comparison, many sites force you to write 4-5 each week). 

Some of the benefits would be that you get to hone your craft as a writer, you can try it out and see if writing is for you, and I may be able to set up interviews with some past/present players from your favorite teams (impossible to promise that one, though).

I'm not currently capable of paying writers, but in the websites that I've ran in the past, I've eventually gotten to the point where I was able to. I won't set a timeframe, but if enough writers come in I couldn't imagine it being any longer than 2-3 months before I can pay people.

The ideal writer will have an opinionated take on the issues surrounding their team. I'm not really looking for someone to write a summary of the box score. You would ideally write something that you yourself would want to read.

I feel that hockey is widely underreported in comparison to the rest of the major professional sports (seriously, look at the Bleacher Report hockey section), and I don't want my site to fall into that same trend. Given that I'm from Michigan, hockey has always been my top sport, but given that it's a website that encompasses every sport, I can't personally devote the time that I would like to, to it.

If anyone is interested, feel free to PM me or just leave a comment. 

Thanks!

I'm a Canucks fan, live in Vancouver and after the lose I watched the interviews after the lose and they kept referring to him as the greatest player in the world. I knew some fans, most Canadians and of course Pens fans consider him the best, but I didn't know players felt the same way.

I'm asking because I really don't think he's the greatest player in the world. As for the best offensive player I can give him that he can do some magical things with the puke not only scoring amazing goals, but setting up amazing goals [(Come on Spezza keep up)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJPjVZjjIt0&feature=player_detailpage). But I would say Malkin is close if not better. As for the greatest hockey player I think you have to look at a player who plays amazing on both ends of the ice and for me that's Pavel Datsyuk. He is literally the craziest player I've ever seen. He has won / been nominated for the Frank J. Selke Trophy many times, can snipe it from almost anywhere and if you give this guy some space (and sometimes even if you don't) he can deke as if you were a statue. I think the best part is he can play against people like Crosby and Malkin and be put on the ice to shut them down. This is what made that Pens/Wings Stanley Cup Final x2 so fun to watch for me.

I'm not bashing Crosby I think he's amazing, but on both ends of the ice I don't think he's as good as everyone makes him out to be.",nhl,1389348180,gangstarapmademe,23,9,True,2014-01-10

However football stadiums like Michigan Stadium could easily accommodate intimate seating, similar to how basketball games are laid out in indoor football stadiums.

Speaking of which, why are there no hockey games played in large indoor stadiums? The NCAA Final Four routinely play in theses venues, as well as NBA games (the Raptors played in Rogers Centre, the Timberwolves played in the Metrodome).

About a month ago, I purchased a Niklas Kronwall Winter Classic jersey. I am a big Red Wings fan and I love the new jersey. Of course, I had to have one. As I walked around in it after purchasing it, I realized a tiny patch was falling off the sleeve (the alternate captain ""A""). I called the owner of the shop and he informed me it was supposed to be stitched (it only had adhesive) and recommended him or I, contact Reebok. I said I would do it because he was a nice guy and I didn't want him to go through the trouble. After all, it was just one patch, and I figured Reebok support would easily fix the small issue.

I had never had a problem with Reebok in the past. I own about 6 Reebok jerseys from a variety of sports and have nothing but good things to say about the jerseys they supply. So I figured they would help me with such a minor issue. I was wrong.

The first time I contacted them was over the the holiday break. I got an email informing me that they were on break. So I figured I would give them time for a respond. They never did.

Since then (2 weeks), I sent two more emails and have still not gotten any sort of response. After being a Reebok purchaser for so long (7-8 years), I cannot believe they could not dignify my email with a response. Despite of how minor the issue is, the fact is that I spent $175 dollars on this jersey. That being said I expect things to not be falling off of it and I expect everything is done with the up-most quality. The amount of un-professionalism that I was shown by Reebok is not one I would expect from such a big company.

Not only was I not offered  some sort of solution for the problem. But Reebok support would not even offer me a response. The fact that you are willing to ignore customers that have an issue with a mistake the factory made, leads me to believe that you don't take accountability for your own mistakes and that you don't respect your customers at all. NHL fans spend a lot of money on your products, and the fact you can't own up or fix a small mistake is just unacceptable.

This will probably the last time I by any product with a Reebok logo on it. Because you would neither fix a small factory error or even offer me a simple response.

you lost a customer,

307,"Give Ovi a Break: Mike Vogal, Arik Parnass","It's a fact of life, it seems, that when times are tough for the Washington Capitals, Alex Ovechkin takes an unfair share from grief from some members of the media. Some of that may come from being our resident superstar, and his path being so closely aligned with Washington's team success. Some of it seems to come from those that just like to fill up a couple of hours of talk radio, with little to no idea what goes on in our locker room. In the latter case, the knives came out again today on Alex in Toronto. More on that below.

Thought it might be good to provide some common sense and statistics to back up the case for how valuable Alex Ovechkin is to the Washington Capitals. Thankfully, we have our statistical guru Arik Parnass (@ArikParnass) on the case. What follows is a reasoned look, at why Alex Ovechkin is truly one of our game's most elite talents. Sometimes, it's good to dig a little deeper for the facts, rather than rely on personal opinions.

My thanks to Arik for putting this together. Well done, sir.

Capitals StatTalk - On Alex Ovechkin's Plus-Minus

There are very few players in the NHL as polarizing as Washington Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin. When he's scoring, hockey fans - and Caps fans most of all - can't get enough of him as he rips one-timers into the upper corner, performs jaw-dropping dekes, and hammers the opposition into the boards. But as soon as this team begins to struggle, the criticisms emerge. ""He's not a good leader."" ""He can't perform in the playoffs."" ""I would rather have Gregory Campbell on my team."" ""They won't win with him."" These are tiring narratives that involve very little thought and even less research. No, the Capitals haven't had a lot of playoff success. It's a fact that the organization has had to deal with. But pegging it all on one player, a player who is over a point-per-game in the post-season in his career, is misguided. It's easy to label a player a winner or a loser based on the outcome of a few short series. We see it in every sport. If Tom Brady of the New England Patriots' career had gone in reverse, he would probably have many of the same labels placed on him as Ovechkin today. ""Seven straight seasons on a good team without a Super Bowl Title? He must just be a pretty boy who can't get it done when it counts."" But football is a team sport, just like hockey. And they are both games that are heavily impacted in the short term - whether people want to admit it or not - by luck, streaks and variance. It's why no NHL player has ever completed a full season with higher than a 20% shooting percentage, and why the Philadelphia Flyers made the Stanley Cup final riding two career backup or minor league goalies. The Boston Bruins are seen as winners, but they were a post away from being eliminated in the first round both of the recent years they made the Cup finals. Remember when Mike Green hit Halak's blocker in the dying minutes of Game 7 against the Montreal Canadiens down by one? In a strikingly similar alternate world, Mike Milbury calls out somebody like Milan Lucic for a lazy shift, and Alex Ovechkin is praised for playing the game the right way after winning a cup. And that brings us to plus-minus, the stat that measures a player's two-way results but for some reason is still seen as the go-to exclusively defensive stat in hockey. Plus-minus is the differential between a player's on-ice goals for and on-ice goals against. But there are a few caveats. First, it only includes goals scored at even strength, which makes some sense considering that power play guys will inherently get more chances to score and penalty kill players will get scored on more often. For some reason, however, the NHL decides to include shorthanded goals in the measure. So while a player can't get a ""+"" for a power play goal for, he can get a ""-"" for a shorthanded goal against. Furthermore, empty-net goals against at even-strength are included. That means that if a team pulls its goalie and the opposition scores, each player on the ice there will get a ""+"" or a ""-"" despite the fact that it was a hell of a lot easier for one of the teams to score than the other.

And that brings us to Alex Ovechkin. Earlier today, former assistant Toronto Maple Leafs GM Bill Watters went on the radio in Toronto and blasted the Capitals' captain for amongst other things his ""no leadership skills"" and pointed out - as many have before - that his ""-16"" rating, second lowest on the team, is inexcusable. Watters, however, went so far as to say that the team would in fact be better off without him. So let's look at what is behind Ovi's plus-minus, and whether or not it is really as bad as it looks. To do so, let's first eliminate empty-net and shorthanded goals from the equation, because they aren't representative of true even-strength play. The Capitals this year have allowed six shorthanded goals, and Ovi has been on the ice for five of those. That takes him down to a ""-11"". The captain has been on the ice for three empty-net goals against and one empty-net goal for, which means that we knock the ticker down to ""-9"". Those in the stats world refer to this as ""True +/-"" and it's a better tool for looking at a player's even-strength success. But even with that, there are issues.

The second big issue with plus-minus as a metric is the fact that it's goal-based, and as I've mentioned here before, goals are rare enough events, even over the course of a season, that they tend to be heavily impacted by variance. While shooting percentages dip up and down like a roller coaster between seasons, shot-based metrics tend to stay fairly stagnant, which makes them a better - not perfect, but better - predictor of true talent and future results. Consider also how often players will receive a ""+"" or a ""-"" after going to the bench or for a play in which they realistically took no part. That ""noise"" - as it's referred to in the stats world - evens out over large periods of time, but can skew smaller samples. So what do Ovechkin's shot-based metrics at even-strength say about him? Ovechkin has a 51.6% Corsi percentage (the Caps take 51.6 percent of the total shots with him on the ice at even-strength), which is third highest on the team amongst regular forwards and his highest since the Boudreau era. So why the ""-9""? Well with Ovechkin on the ice at even-strength, the Caps have shot only 5.9%. That on-ice shooting percentage ranks 245th out of 284 forwards who have played at least 75% of their teams' games this season. In other words, a guy who has shot the lights out on the power play hasn't been getting the bounces at even-strength, and neither have his linemates. On the other side of the coin, Caps goalies are only maintaining a .916 sv% with Ovechkin on the ice at even-strength. That on-ice save percentage ranks 186th out of that same group of forwards. In both those statistics, Ovechkin is second-last on his own team, which shows that although a small part of these issues may be systematic, a larger part of it is luck.

Ovechkin is never going to have it easy in the NHL, at least not until he wins a Stanley Cup. He is a poster boy for laziness and selfishness, even though he has earned neither of those labels. It's easy to cherry-pick statistics, just as it's easy to pinpoint bad shifts, but if you don't know how they fit into the bigger context, you will mislead yourself and others. The Capitals have work to do to get out of this slump, and the team's even-strength play - while improved - is at the top of that list. But to look at one person, or even one very flawed statistic, as the source of the team's problems is simply wrong. Alex Ovechkin is the present and future of the Capitals, and that's still the way it should be.

Anyway, I went to watch a local team last night in Toyohashi, Japan, and I was pretty hooked on the idea of hockey immediately.

Since I'm not from America, I have no real allegiance to any particular city or team. I'm a Bulls fan, so I guess maybe that link would make sense. It feels a bit cheap to immediately start following the current champs though. I chose the Bulls mainly because they had Luol Deng and I like the Blues Brothers, so that's the level of decision-making going on here.

**My question is**: if you were coming in fresh, with no tie to any team at all (and no geographical convenience factor), but knowing what you do now about the league, which team would you follow?

* Which teams play the most entertaining hockey?
* Which teams are being managed ""correctly"" (not making dumb trades or handing out crazy contracts, drafting well etc.) and are likely to not end up frustrating the hell out of you for years to come? (you don't want to end up following the NHL equivalent of the Cavaliers)

Personally, I tend to pay more attention to teams in places I want to visit, so that would put Seattle, Vancouver BC, Portland, Denver, Chicago, and San Francisco higher up in my preference list.

458,A couple of questions about the new playoff format,"Besides for being absolutely ridiculous, the new playoff format raises some questions that I hope someone can help me with.

I understand that the set up is that the first two rounds of the playoffs will be played within each division* so that for the semi finals each division will have one representative, the two eastern conference teams will play each other (and the same for the west) and the stanley cup finals will match one team from the west with one team from the east.
The asterisk is, of course, for the exception that only 3 teams from each division will automatically make the playoffs and the last 2 spots in each conference will be wild card spots that can be held by teams in either division.  If one team from each division gets a wild card spot then they play within their division's playoff for the first 2 rounds and all is well.  But, if both wild card teams come from the same division one will be sent to play in the other division's playoff for the first 2 rounds.  So my questions are...

1) Which of the 2 wild card teams gets sent to the other division?  According to this page (http://espn.go.com/nhl/playoffs/matchups) on espn.com it is the wild card team with less points that gets shipped to the other division, however this doesn't really make much sense to me.  Shouldn't the team that has less points, and is theoretically not as good, stay to play the one seed from their own division so that the champion of that division gets a (theoretically) easier series?  Don't they deserve it for winning the tougher decision?
Using the current standings in the eastern conference my example is that right now Montreal (64 pts) and Detroit (60 pts) would get the two wild card spots, and Detroit would go to the Metropolitan Division playoffs, but is this fair to Boston?  Pittsburgh would play Detroit, and they do have more points than Boston, but presumably in an easier division (this might not be actually true, but in theory it could be)
Or, perhaps the reason why Detroit gets swapped and not Montreal is because Pittsburgh has more points than Boston.  That would seem fair to me, but I'm not sure if that is the actual reason.

2) If the second wild card team gets swapped divisions, do they automatically receive the 4 seed?  For instance, if Detroit has more points than Columbus, does Detroit still end up as the 4 seed and Columbus the 3 seed?  If that is the case than Pittsburgh, the 1 seed, will be playing a team with more points in the first round than the Rangers, a 2 seed.  That doesn't seem fair either?

This all may sound confusing and rather pedantic, and in reality to win the Stanley Cup you just have to beat everybody you play and if you do lose to a team early on then you don't deserve the cup anyway, but if we are going to place some importance on the regular season than it has to be so that the teams that do better get better seeds in the playoffs and more likely than not have an easier road through the bracket.",nhl,1391470191,zmost22,5,12,True,2014-02-03

Indiana Pacers have the best record in the NBA, but they also have the best road winning percentage in the Eastern Conference.


That strength away from house will be needed Tuesday night if the Pacers are going to record their first regular-season road victory against the Atlanta Hawks in over seven years.

Indiana (37-10) has dropped 12 consecutive regular-season games in Atlanta since a win on Dec. 22, 2006, the team's longest active road losing streak against any opponent. Most of the matchups haven't been close, with the Pacers losing by an average of 10.6 points per contest.


Granger's performance was particularly encouraging after he missed the first 25 games of the season because of a strained calf. In seven games prior to Monday's win, the former All-Star had scored just 5.9 points per contest on 13 of 43 (30.2 percent) from the field.

Indiana has one of the lowest-scoring reserve units in the league, with its bench players averaging 25.3 points per game.

""We made a point of trying to profit Danny going (versus Orlando),"" Pacers forward David West said. ""I thought he did a good job of coming out getting shots, getting his looks. He's getting his legs back under him, his timing's coming, and we know that our bench is dangerous.""

West and fellow gigantic man Ian Mahinmi each sustained injuries Monday, but both said they should be ready to play Tuesday.

The Hawks (25-21) seek their sixth win in eight games after overcoming Kevin Love's 43 points for a 120-113 victory over Minnesota on Saturday. Four players scored at least 19 points, led by Kyle Korver's 24 on 7-of-9 shooting.

Coach Mike Budenholzer said defense sparked Atlanta's comeback from an 11-point deficit in the second quarter.

""I think the third quarter tonight was something we can reference going forward on how we desire to play, particularly defensively, to keep them to 21 points in a quarter with the way they can score,"" he said.

While Budenholzer credited his team's defense for Saturday's win, his offense has been much improved lately also.

Atlanta is averaging 111.0 points in its last eight contests, nearly 10 points more than it scored per game in its first 38.

Also valuable recently for the Hawks has been their depth, evidenced by having five double-digit scorers in each of the past four games.

Korver led five players in double figures with 17 points in the Hawks' win over Indiana in January.

I'm not talking about the really dirty elbowing hits or the obvious boarding suspensions, but some of the hits that would be clean, if they would have been body checks, rather than head checks, seem like they could have been avoided, if the player hadn't blatantly exposed their head for the hit.

161,Getting tired of the expansion haters that think it will dilute the talent pool.,"And even if it does dilute the talent pool, I think this is the best thing that could possibly happen to hockey. With so many more talented players coming out of Europe and the U.S and better training programs there are more, better players than there has ever been.    
And I would love to see someone put up points like Gretzky and Lemieux did again but it will never happen when everyone is on such a level playing field, we would probably need 45 teams to see that kind of success again, if not more.    
I think diluting the talent pool would be the easiest way to bring up scoring in the NHL, but the fact is that adding another 2 or 3 or even 4 teams is not going to make that much of a difference. There are entire teams in Europe, while they wouldn't win many games in the NHL would compete.  I know one of the NHL teams lost in Finland this year during exhibition.     
Take the top 100 guys not playing in the NHL and I bet you make some alright NHL teams, spread them around the league and I bet there isn't a discernible difference in quality.

1- What is Icing? Is it when you try to spray another play by skidding on your skates?

2- What are the rules for fighting? For checking?

3- What is a Power Play and how is one started? Also are there any similar game ""scenarios"" I should know about? I get the sense it has something to do with penalties?

4- What is the significance of the little blue circle in front of the goal?

5- What do the other lines on the ice mean? Like that big blue line?

6- Why is it that sometimes one team can't have a goalie in the net? Is this related to Power Plays/Penalties?

7- How does ""playcalling"" work in Hockey? And also, timeouts? I have never seen a player look like they are actively receiving any instruction from the sideline- is the coach making calls I just cant hear/see? 

8- I thought I heard an announcer say something about offsides, so how does offsides work in Hockey and is it different from soccer?

And anything else you think I should know, would be appreciated!

edit: Another one I forgot that has been nagging at me- what does it mean to ""kill a penalty"" or to not kill one? I would think its when a foul is called that leads to a player going 1 on 1 with the goalie?

Brian Burke has had something with Bobby Ryan for a long time.

And in history, it made kind of sense because that’s the player they kind of got, a scorer. And so I looked into it, and somebody who would know told me “there is no freaking way Brian Burke is making that trade because he hates Ryan, never liked him, didn’t want to draft him and wanted Jack Johnson instead.” So, I went to check on it and I was told no, and I never went with it. It was probably going to go in one of my 30 Thoughts blogs or something, and I couldn’t prove it. And today or actually last night after the team got announced and those articles appeared online as I was driving back to my hotel from Ann Arbor, I got a call from the guy who told me that, and he was like “see?

107,(Serious) question about fights in the NHL.,"Alright hockey fans, 

I'm new to watching hockey, a friend of mine just got me interested, and there have been a few things I've wondered about fights.

I found NHL-fight etiquette list and it said things such as

- Players, enforcers (explain that title if you will), will respect a rival players decline of a fight if he has an injury bothering him.

- It's frowned upon to fight someone at the end of their shift

- It also says that a reason a lot of fights may happen early, without any instigation, is because they don't want it to be declined due to injuries.

So here are my questions:

1) Why would they fight early on without instigation? Is there a point to it?

2) The point of a fight is to win, but with these rules, it never gives anyone an upper-hand, isn't that what you want in a fight?

3) what do players fight about the most?

I may have more questions, but can't think of them right now.

But reading that stuff made me feel like it's a bunch of buddies just fighting to give the crowd something to watch.

I don't mean to sound stupid, I'm just really curious.

Thank you in advance for the answers.",nhl,1384566282,hehateme44,24,3,True,2013-11-15

I think that the ""1 point for overtime"" rule really lowers the intensity and level at which the game is played at, and, personally, I despise the shootout.  My brother disagrees.  He loves the shootout and the one point given for overtime.  If I could have it my way, the shootout would be retired, and two 5 minute overtime periods would be played (both 5 on 5) and if the teams were still knotted at the end of those, a tie would be declared and then and only then would each team be given 1 point.  If a team won it in overtime, it would be treated as a normal win, 2 points to the winner, zero to the loser.

When I was growing up and watching sports in 2nd grade for the first time, I followed every team on TV. However, until recently, the Blackhawks did not have a TV deal so I never got to see them play. This, combined with the fact that my parents wouldn't let me play hockey because it was too expensive (dunno if thats true, they probably were afraid or something), led to me never developing a love for the sport.

The first time I started watching hockey was in 2010. I knew the Hawks were good, so I watched each of their playoff games. That was super fun. Then I did the same thing this year, watched every playoff game, and got to see another great playoff run.

So I know I am a spoiled hockey brat in the sense that my team is having a ton of success and I am not a good enough fan to deserve or appreciate it. I have played some of the NHL video games, and I own NHL 13 and it is super fun.

Anyway that is my background on hockey. What is the best way for me to get into this sport? What are some of the best websites I should be reading? How do I know how to evaluate how skilled players are? For instance, almost every goal I see seems like luck to me, which I know is stupid, but it seems to often be a mad scramble in front of the net. As much fun as hockey is for me to watch, I never know what is happening.

186,Why the Colorado Avalanche will be the next big team,"
      The Colorado Avalanche again have had yet another disappointing season in the NHL. With their last playoff berth in 2009-10, the Avalanche continue to disappoint fans by placing near the bottom of the league two years in a row. With newly added Patrick Roy as head coach and young Nathan Mackinnon, the Av's look to change their future.

      This years entry draft General Manager Joe Sakic made a very shocking decision. Instead of drafting No. 1 overall defence man Seth Jones, he took Nathan Mackinnon. In their current place as 27th in the NHL for goals against allowing 150 goals in 42 games this past season, drafting a defender seemed to be the obvious choice. Yes Nathan is speedy centre and has the potential to be a point per game NHL star, but offence is not what the Avalanche organization needs. Personally I'm puzzled why Joe Sakic did not draft Seth Jones. Playing in the WHL for the Portland Winter-hawks, Jones put up an impressive 56 points in 61 games. Not only is he a 6'4'' 205 pound shut down defence man, he can put up the offensive numbers on the blue line. On the power play this year the Av's placed 24th in the NHL. With Seth Jones and Erik Johnson at the point, the power play conversion rate could have improved dramatically. While their number one net minder Semyon Varlamov had some solid games and is an NHL starting goaltender, he can't preform well with the defence he has in front of him.

      As we have seen the negative of not drafting Seth Jones, here's the positive of having Nathan Mackinnon on your roster. In the 2012-13 QMJHL season, Mackinnon put up 78 points in 58 games. The following year Nathan hit an impressive 75 points in just 44 games. This amazing skater and fantastic puck handler has a natural talent for goal scoring. Along with his quick hands, Mackinnon is surprisingly physical and is not afraid to battle for the puck along the boards or in front of the net. He is the full package for a starter at centre.  








Here is the current Colorado Avalanche roster

Gabriel Landeskog                    Matt Duchene                    P.A. Parenteau
Alex Tanguay                   	   Paul Statsny    	                 Jamie Mcginn
Cody Mcleod			   Ryan O'Reilly	                 Steve Downie

			 Tyson Barrie                    Matt Hunwick 
                             Jan Hejda		            Stefan Elliott		
			 Erik Johnson		   Cory Sarich

 	Semyon Varlamov		Jean-Sebastien Giguere


      Now down to their forwards. First off when you look at this team, you immediately notice their strength down the middle. Matt Duchene, as their number 1 centre, put up 43 points in 47 games. Duchene has a natural feel for the puck and can put up solid numbers making him one of the most feared players for any goaltender. Playing second line centre is silver medalist in the 2010 olympics Paul Stastny. Stastny has not lived up to expectations over the past few years. After signing a 6 year deal in 2009-10 for 33 million, Stastny's point total has declined from 79 points in the 2009-10 season. This past season Stastny put up only 24 points in 40 games. While he was rumoured to be on the trading market throughout this past year and offseason, the Av's have decided to keep him. If Stastny can find chemistry with his line mates and be the 70 point player a year he is, the Avalanche will have a much better shot at the playoffs. The 3rd line introduces young centre Ryan O'Reilly. After all that commotion with the offer sheet earlier this year, O'Reilly preformed very well hitting 20 points in 29 games. He is every teams dream 3rd line centre. Not only is he a high skilled playmaker, but he can be a reliable point producer for this streaky team.

      Playing the wing along side Duchene is P.A. Parenteau. Pierre Alexandre had a breakout season with the Islanders in the 2010-11season reaching 53 points. He returned the following year and put up a solid 67 points tallying 49 assists. This season with the Av's he hit 43 points in just 48 games. P.A. Parenteau is one of the most underrated play makers in the NHL. He has a deep understanding of the game and can make unbelievable plays with his passing ability. 

      
      
      
      Then there's the famous Gabriel Landeskog, the youngest captain in NHL history at only 19 years of age. Many believed the pressure would shake the young Swede, and it did. After reaching 52 points in 2011-2012, Gabriel scored only 17 points in 36 games this past season. The pressure built on his shoulders and he collapsed. But this isn’t the end of him, he has an amazing skating ability and can dangle his way out of trouble. We have only seen the beginning of this remarkable swede. 

      Recently the Avalanche traded for forward Alex Tanguay. Many people look down at this trade and criticized Colorado for picking him up but I think that he will benefit the 9th youngest team in the NHL with his expertize and experience. That meaning don't expect him to put up the numbers he used to. Tanguay can also chip in a little on the power play as he has the ability to control the play and can pass the puck very well. He will be good for 30, maybe 40, points depending if he can pick up chemistry with Paul Stastny. 

      As the Avalanche have built their forwards and have a very talented group of goal scorers and playmakers, their defence could be much better. Having Matt Hunwick and Tyson Barrie as their top two isn't the greatest. I'm not saying they're bad players per say, but they are definitely not ready to be a top two defensive pair on an NHL team. First off what the Av's need is a fully developed NHL ready defence man who can tally 30-40 points a year and can be the shut down D-men that they desperately need. That player was to be supposed Erik Johnson. Drafted number one overall in the 2006 entry draft by the St.Louis Blues, Johnson ended up with the Avalanche. In his rookie year he tallied 39 points in 79 games with the Blues. This past year, he hit only four points in 31 games. Expectations were and are very high on 25 year old Erik Johnson. Johnson definitely has some making up to do. One thing that Johnson and the team can benefit from is an experienced D-man that could be mentors to these players. Could former Avalanche pick in the 2002 entry draft Tom Gilbert be the answer. As of now Gilbert seems to be KHL bound but I think he could be a good addition to a struggling defensive teams like the Av's. Since hitting 45 points with the Oilers in the 08-09 seasons, the 6'3'' 206 pound defence man point total has dropped tremendously over the years. This doesn’t mean he is completely useless, as he can reach 20 points and be an effective go to defence man and help out on the penalty kill. With 10 million in cap space, Joe Sakic should definitely take a look at Gilbert. Another viable option is the aging Filip Kuba. This Czech defender has a powerful slap shot at the point and back in the day, he was a consistent 30 point player. Yes Kuba is not the player he was back with the Senators and Wild, but his contributions would be more off the ice than on. Kuba can provide playoff experience and leadership in the locker room. He can be a mentor to the younger players. Another benefit is that he is relatively healthy playing 44 out of 48 games last season with the panthers. 

      Once the Colorado Avalanche pick up at least two more defenders and Erik Johnson and Paul Stastny have a rebound year, this team will be on the right track to a playoff berth.

12,Anyone interested in joining my ESPN Fantasy Hockey League?,"Hey guys, I started up a 12 team fantasy league earlier today for fun. I'll be playing in a different league that's head-to-head, and decided to make this one a light-hearted public game to get to know some new people from reddit.

A bit of background: I designed this league so that it's very low maintenance, and generally just for fun. It's free to play, and it's cumulative season points based. Kinda like rotisserie, but not quite. I edited some of the scoring settings so that values like PIM, Blocked Shots and Hits get you points, but a player's (+/-) isn't weighted. This way, if you want a defenseman who thinks he's a goalie or a player like Chris Neil on your team, you can pick them and still gain points (since in any other league he'd mostly cost you points from day-to-day).

There are 10 open spots left in the league, and the draft is Sunday, September 22nd at 7pm Eastern. Again, this is all just for fun and low maintenance. Feel free to join, and leave me a comment or a PM if you do sign up, or if you have any questions!

I like the technical-ness of hockey. And I like the speed. I don't know how much this varies from team to team but I think it does. I was watching a bit of the Kings v Sharks playoff series and I enjoyed how the Sharks were playing.

I know there is going to be a lot of variation and disagreement but it should be fun. And if it comes down to it maybe I'll just pick at random with some bias.

Twas the night before opening night, and all through the state
BLUES fans lie staring, at this roster, so great
The ice at Scottrade, fresh painted and smooth
Sits waiting for Oshie to make a dazzling move

Sleep will not visit, because anticipation runs wild
Feeling so giddy, like a naive little child
Thoughts of Stewie, tapping in freebies
give any Blues fan the true heebie-jeebies

So I stare at the ceiling, a smile on my face
so excited to begin this Stanley Cup chase
To watch Jaro flash glove, and leave us all speechless
To chant EL-LI-OTT loud as his pad somehow reaches

To see Backes lead us, the definition of grit,
to watch Reaves land punches while I scream ""EAT SHIT""
To watch Pietrangelo win his very first Norris
While cheers for towel man ring loud from the chorus

To see Schwartzy and Bergie and Vlad Tarasenko
with vets like Steener and Barret, and now Brenden Morrow
To see Roy be the space maker the Blues have been craving
and Polak and Bouwmeester keep the rally towels waving

Hitchcock will guide us, just don't listen to his voice
Unless a creepy high voice, is your voice of choice
This is the year, fans, there's no way we can lose
So scream with me everyone, ""LETS GO BLUES""

399,Tampa Bay Lightning analysis anyone?,"I just started watching hockey last year. I mean i've watched it before then, but not every single game as i do now. I'm starting to really understand the game, but the tampa bay lightning confuse me on their status and current condition. I do think they gave Boston a really good fight even though falling short 3-1. If it wasn't for their goal keeper, Rask (who played outstandingly good), I honestly think boston would've been stomped on. They were out shot 33-25. Lost their first fight, and the second fight was even in my opinion (refs broke it up but lots of punches thrown) but enough to pump up the lightning to tie it up to 1-1.

Also the tampa bay lightning i've noticed has a way stronger and bigger team now. Labrie & Gudas being the strongest but even the rookies like Johnson who even though not big made himself known in that game. 

The only thing that I know sets them back is their goalies. Bishop I deff think is a great goalie. Every game i've seen him in he does great (typically). Lindback though drives me nuts, beginning of last season he was untouchable, barely ever let pucks go by him, now every time he's in net i just see what should be simple saves turn into goals for the opposing team. I do give him props on a few good saves he made tonight, but some of the pucks that went by him tonight kind of made me roll my eyes... Whether it's his fault or the D's fault though i'm stilll trying to figure out.

The defense as well is DEFINITLY an improvement since last year, however they still made a few mistakes tonight two of them being costly. Break away, and a penalty shot for Boston.

Someone that has a lot more experience in hockey analysis i'd prefer to hear from though, these are just my opinions. Not trying to sound too one sided either, sorry if i did, Lightning is my team so it's hard not too lol. 

Even though we lost tonight I was still proud of the overall performance of the team, and the game i watched tonight. It was pure, great, well played hockey on both ends. 

Now please tell me your views and thoughts of the lightning, thanks! :D

493,Which NHL team am I a fan of?,"I've been pondering this conundrum for quite some time.  I've always been an NHL fan, but I was never QUITE sure which was my favorite team.

THE CANDIDATES

I grew up in Cleveland, OH, a pretty big hockey town.  But we don't have an NHL team.  I tended to follow the Red Wings most closely as a kid, because they were nearby and had those great teams in the late 90s/early 00s, but it felt weird rooting for a Michigan team.  Maybe I could be a Stars fan, since the Cleveland Barons were absorbed by the Minnesota North Stars who then moved to Dallas?  That doesn't quite feel right.

We had the Cleveland Lumberjacks growing up, the IHL affiliate of the Penguins.

My parents are from NYC, and we'd go to Rangers games sometimes when we went there to visit family.

I lived in Denver for a while as a small child, so when they got the Avalanche (which was after I moved away) I thought maybe that could be my team.  They even won the Stanley cup in their first season.  But it didn't stick.

I went to college in Washington DC, and I went to a bunch of Caps games, and even got a Caps jersey.

I then transferred to Ohio State, at the exact same time Columbus got the Blue Jackets.  I decided I'd become a Blue Jackets fan, after 20 years of confusion.  But they just never quite did it for me either.

After college I spent a couple years in LA and thought maybe I'd become a Kings fan.  But it just didn't happen.

I now live in the Raleigh-Durham area and have been to a couple Canes games, but again, they just haven't really gripped me at any point.

Help! Who is my team?  I think the Red Wings are probably the leading candidate, but they just don't feel quite right, like the Indians, Browns and Cavs do, you know?",nhl,1381341479,[deleted],0,1,True,2013-10-09

It made me think about how I couldve seen my teammate coming.

Under the Coyotes parking plan, full season ticket holders will have an opportunity to purchase permit parking in the Coyotes premium lot located on the east side of Jobing.com Arena (Lot G) for $645 ($15 per game).

Lots J, K, A, B will be available for $12 through advanced purchase via Ticketmaster or $15 on the day of game. There will also be a $10 parking option in Lots X and Y.

132,Anyone on reddit know any nhl players personally or have had any experiences meeting nhl players,"I actually got the opportunity to meet team canada preliminary roster in calgary at a restaurant where they were having a team bonding. I got 14 signatures and 5 pictures. I got to meet Jonathan Toews, John Tavares, Steven Stamkos, Martin St Louis, Jordan Staal,  Corey Perry, Taylor Hall, Jordan Eberle, Shea Weber, PK Subban, Dan Boyle, Roberto Luongo, Corey Crawford and Lindy Ruff. The whole team was basically sitting beside us in a VIP section but as the players were leaving me and my friend got to meet them. I really wanted to meet sidney crosby but he booked it out of the place with 6 escorts. Eberle, Stamkos, Luongo, Lindy Ruff, Dan Boyle and Taylor hall were probably the nicest guys there which surprised me cause taylor hall looks like a massive douche. Carey Price, Corey Perry and John tavares were the biggest losers there though. Martin St.Louis was real chill he didn't talk much but he was a good guy dude is definitely shorter than he looks he is probably 5:6 and at most probs 5:7. Carey Price and Corey Perry wouldn't take a picture with me and i didn't even bother asking Tavares he was just a douche who didnt even finish the signature on my shirt. I almost got kicked out on top of that because some douche who was helping the players out came over and threatened to kick me out but he ended up leaving with Crosby which opened the door for me to meet a lot more players. Stamkos was so nice that he even held up a napkin of my friends name who couldn't make it and took a pic with me . P.K subban was real cool dude to he took signed my shirt went to the bathroom and came out and took a pic with me and my friend and walked off with some girl. It was real funny cause corey crawford said no to sign my shirt but he did it anyways haha. On top of that NO HOMO I went to the bathroom and got a text and whipped out my phone and put it up to my face and brad marchand thought i was taking a picture of him pissing :/ He also looks shorter than he actually is in real life hes probably 5:7/5:8. The next day I actually got to meet a couple guys from the TSN hockey panel James Duthie, Bob Mckenzie and Darren Dreger they were all really nice especially James Duthie dude was hammered!! I told him that I was watching him all day to see if they would give any details on meeting the players he told me to get a girlfriend and he actually ended up telling me the best place to meet the players. I eventually got to meet Marc and Jordan Stall and Chris Kuntiz a couple minutes later and  they were super chill dudes especially Chris Kunitz he was cracking jokes and all and he even told me what time the players were going and leaving the arena! Just to keep it short I met sidney crosby twice and i backed off and didnt get his autograph and let other people get it but I did ask for a picture and he said he would but the people he was with said he couldnt and they took him away but i eventually got his autograph and the dude stole my sharpie! I screamed at him saying he did and even screamed at the people he was with and he gave me the sorry i dont have it look with his arms shrugging and his entourage said they didn't have it. I am actually pretty rattled about it when everyone is saying how cool it is that sidney took it. I pulled an all nighter to meet him and i eventually did the next morning which was pretty sweet. I can see why some players are don't sign because of some losers who have like 14 of these players autographs and just follow them everywhere.Its funny cause this one dude I met had 8 crosby signatures and when brad merchand came he asked him for an autograph and didn't sign shit for him but signed for me hahaha. For everyone who thinks Dion Phaneuf is a douche you are retarded because he legit hung up with whoever he was on the phone with to take a photo and sign my stuff for me and the next day he was so welcoming. I helped the teams bus driver move the rope that blocks the fans and the players and then after I did that I asked him if he could take me on the bus to get some more autographs or if he could take my shirt and get it signed but he told me he couldn't and said that if you help people good thinks will happen to you so this is a message for all you people out there. Rick Nash did not sign once and he straight bolted for the bus which surprised me cause he seems so cool. Carey price is a pretty big douche and I have lost a lot of respect for him. When he was leaving for his car he was with P.K and they put their stuff away and P.K. came back to sign autographs where Carey didn't even look over once and went straight for the car. All i gotta say is Steven Yzerman is stricly business and the only reason i got his autograph is because i cut him off when he was walking towards the hotel and he did not say one word at all. FYI Drew Doughty, Kris Letang are massive partiers! I met a lot of players and im glad their were fans as dedicated as me out there who kept me motivated to stay dudes showed up hammered to the hotel when i saw them and some dirt on the players is when Price, Subban and one more player i forget showed up to the hotel the cab driver didn't know who they were but he told me the whole drive from the place he picked them up to the hotel they were talking about how many girls they banged and stuff like that LOOOOL. In all in all I ended up being short of 10 players autographs and got 4 managements autographs. If you think I am bragging about meeting all these players please don't be I am just telling you guys my experience with these players and I have been dying to meet these players since I was a kid because they usually have the orientation camp in my city and I got the opportunity to go this time around so why not. If you take this the wrong way i apologize for your bitter attitude towards me and please do move on in life. ",nhl,1377510495,raptorsfan4life,237,14,True,2013-08-26

It is a league where you get to make your own player, you will eventually get drafted and start playing in the SMJHL. We sim on STHS hockey simulator. You earn points by spending contract money you get from your contract, or completing Point Tasks. The Point Task director gives the entire league Point Tasks to complete, sometimes they're things like ""write 100 words on what type of player you would like to be"" but they're all different. You can do play by plays of games and write articles to earn money to spend on points to improve your player. If you stay active your player will eventually become a top prospect and eventually get drafted into the SHL! Become a star forward, defensemen or goalie! Make your way through the SHL and become a Hall of Famer!! The community is great and we are all hockey loving people. If you want a place to spend a little bit of extra time you may have then join the SHL. I joined the SHL around a year and a half ago and haven't stopped enjoying improving my player and interacting with the community.
We're going into our 15th season and we're still going strong.

From 80-85 points it costs 2 points to move the attribute up one. From 85-90 it costs three points to move the attribute up one. From 90-95 it costs four points to move the attribute up one and from 95-99 it costs 5 points to move the attribute up one.

I think a bigger rink would ensure player safety, or at least compared to now. It would keep skill really high, and size would also matter as there is more room to hit or run players.

Favorites:

1. Bruins- Started watching hockey consistently for the 09-10 season. After the first couple games, I saw documentaries on Orr and Neely and liked their style of play. After watching a few Bruins games, I was sold by their hard-hitting and iron-like defense. Also, I love the city.

2. Red Wings- Most of my family became Wings fans during and after their Calder Cup successes in the 80's. They were the first team I really watched.

3. Canadiens- Sacrilege, whatever. Montreal always gives and electrifying performance during matchup a with the B's and I honestly enjoy the intensity of that rivalry.

4. Blackhawks- I was impressed with their playoff run in 2010 and this season, and now that the Wings are in the East, I need a new Western favorite.

5. Rangers- Tough call because of indifference. I live in New York so I know a lot of Rags fans and they're respectable fans and the team is nice to watch.

Least Favorites-

1. Canucks- Any Vancouver fan around my area is a giant douchenozzle, Burrows is a twat, Luongo is a tool, and now they have Torts. All over clown show, IMO.

2. Flyers- Never forgive, never forget. I hate living in their AHL territory.

3. Canadiens- Obligatory. Fuck the Habs.

4. Devils- I have a burning hatred for the state of New Jersey, so it had to happen. Plus, the only Devils fan I know is a dumb cunt closet fan.

193,Expansion Draft,"How would an NHL expansion work? I've done some research and there are basically two options:

- **Expansion teams sign free agents:** 
Although there are many *decent* free agents available, you would certainly not be able to draw enough fan support having a team consisting of Scott Gomez and Hal Gill. Expanding one team from free agents seems non-logical, let alone two teams that will ride the bottom seed for many many years. If you read [this](http://www.thehockeynews.com/articles/52950-NHL-ripe-for-expansion-to-32-teams.html) article, the teams are built around washed-up veterans that IMO wouldn't do well.

- **Expansion Draft:** From my understanding, teams would be able to protect a certain number of players. No where could I find the amount of players though. Nor could I find if prospects would be protected. This option seems to benefit the expansion teams more, but could really hurt some power teams when trying to decide who to keep (prospects vs. 3rd liners). **EX:** A team like Boston is built off all 4 of their 4 lines, so it would really hurt their team structure trying to hand-pick the players that mean the most to them.

### Game Notes:

* There were no crossover games between conferences in the shortened NHL season, so the Boston Bruins and Chicago Blackhawks did not play each other. They last met Oct. 15, 2011, at United Center, with the Bruins winning 3-2 in a shootout. Tim Thomas started that game in net for Boston, and Corey Crawford started for Chicago and made 35 saves. The prior game between the teams in Boston was March 29, 2011, with the Bruins winning 3-0. Boston forward Shawn Thornton left that game after his head was cut by a skate blade and the Bruins claimed a Blackhawks player said something to stir up harsh feelings as he left the ice.

* Two of the oldest franchises in the NHL are ready for a series that has the potential to be a classic. Not only is it the first time since 1979 that two Original Six franchises have played for the Cup -- and the first time the Bruins and Blackhawks have faced each other in the Final -- but the Blackhawks and Bruins are built similarly and play quite a bit alike. Chicago and Boston have foundations set on defense and goaltending, but have plenty of offense to go with it.

### Injury Report:

* Gregory Campbell (leg fracture) is out for the rest of the postseason for the Bruins.

* The Blackhawks report no injuries.

### Game Notes:

* After a suffocating 2-0 victory in Game 3 on Monday, the Boston Bruins are poised to take control of the Stanley Cup Final with a victory on Wednesday night at TD Garden (8 p.m. ET). The Bruins took advantage of a surprise health issue that scratched Chicago Blackhawks star right wing Marian Hossa with an undisclosed upper-body injury after the pre-game warm up. Goalie Tuukka Rask got credit for a shutout, but the defense in front of him snuffed out almost all good scoring chances for the Blackhawks.

* Chicago also got drubbed in the faceoff circle, losing 40 of 56 draws for a paltry 29 percent success rate. Boston used that advantage to dominate puck possession and outskate the Blackhawks almost the entire game. Now, it’s up to Chicago to respond – whether Hossa plays in Game 4 or not.

* History, apparently, is also against the Blackhawks at this point. Since the Final went to a seven-game format in 1939, teams that won Game 3 after splitting the first two contests have won the Cup 21 of 25 times. The Tampa Bay Lightning in 2004 was the last team to drop Game 3 in that scenario and win the Cup.


***

### Injury Report:

* Boston's Gregory Campbell (leg fracture) is out for the rest of the postseason, while Nathan Horton is playing through an upper-body injury that knocked him out of Game 1 in overtime.

* Marian Hossa is being called ""day-to-day"" for the Blackhawks and Quenneville said on Tuesday that he's ""likely"" to play in Game 4.

When a defense plays as good as the B's played in game 3, more credit should go to the great defense and WAY less to the goaltender. It doesn't seem fair to me to not put blame on a goalie after a loss when they get all the credit after a win. Defense wins games way more than a goalie. I'm not saying Rask deserves no credit, but make sure to look at how great that defense was in game 3 before saying that all the praise should go to Rask.

### Game Notes:

* The Chicago Blackhawks knew they couldn't afford to fall behind 3-1 in this series heading into Wednesday night's Game 4 at TD Garden and made sure it didn't happen. The Blackhawks found another level to outlast the Boston Bruins 6-5 in yet another overtime classic -- the third OT game of the series -- that evened things again at two games apiece.

* Next up in this Stanley Cup Final is a critical Game 5 at United Center on Saturday (8 p.m. ET), exactly one week after the Bruins stole an overtime victory in the same building to even the series at 1-1. After needing overtime to decide four of their past five playoff games, the Blackhawks gladly took the two-day break between games and look to repeat what they did in 2010 against the Philadelphia Flyers.

* Chicago dominated Game 5 that year to go up 3-2 in the and then polished it off with Patrick Kane's overtime goal in Philadelphia to clinch the franchise's first Stanley Cup title since 1961. If the Blackhawks can mirror that effort this time, it'll be their second title in four seasons with a core group of stars that's still in their prime. Conversely, if the Bruins can swipe another road victory they'll head home for Game 6 with a chance to clinch their second Cup title in three seasons.

And yes, I'm a Bruins fan, but that's irrelevant to this matter for the most part. I've watched other sports (mainly soccer) since I can remember, so I'm familiar with commentary, and feel like I can recognize when a side is being taken. Soccer got boring to watch (duh), so I picked up watching hockey. The game's awesome, I love it.

So these commentators have done a pretty good job for the most part on the playoffs, but this series, they've really been pissing me off, to the point where I'd rather mute the TV. It stinks, because I like hearing the stats and learning more about the game, but there isn't a minute of the series that they haven't been kissing Chicago's ass. And I'm not saying anything bad about Chicago; they're a great team, and it's been an awesome series so far. But when Chicago's winning, it's because Chicago is playing great. When Boston is winning, Chicago ""isn't playing their game"".

During the 6-5 game, replays were abundant for Chicago goals and plays. The announcers were breaking down the goals, commending them on deflected goals and whatnot. Yet, when Boston equalizes with great passing and a stunning shot, not a word is muttered. If it is, it's what Chicago did wrong.

What really kind of pissed me off was when they said one of our players (I think Lucic) ""sold the call"" on a high stick. They re-played it, and he clearly got smacked hard in the mouth, and they were insistent that he was still selling it.

Am I just crazy, or have these guys been extremely biased this entire series?

Either way, I'm looking forward to tonight. Go Bruins, but if Chicago wins, congrats. Whoever gets the cup this year will have earned it.",nhl,1372101971,rfederici,3,0,True,2013-06-24

***

**Time:** Monday June 24, 2013

* **8:00 PM Eastern (Boston)**

* 7:00 PM Central (Chicago)

* 6:00 PM Mountain

* 5:00 PM Pacific

***

**Location:** TD Garden, Boston, Massachusetts

**TV:** NBC, CBC, RDS

***

### Game Notes:

* It has taken three calendar years and four NHL seasons for the Chicago Blackhawks to work their way back to this point. The Blackhawks also led the 2010 Stanley Cup Final 3-2 after five games before wrapping up the franchise's first NHL championship in 49 years by beating the host Philadelphia Flyers in overtime of Game 6.

* This time, Game 6 will be held on Monday (8 p.m. ET) in a different location (TD Garden), but the Blackhawks again find themselves feeling good with two cracks at winning the Stanley Cup - a potential Game 7, if necessary, would be at United Center on Wednesday night.

* Patrick Kane, who clinched that 2010 title with the OT goal, scored twice on Saturday night to in Chicago's 3-1 Game 5 victory at United Center, and the Windy City is all puffed up with anticipation about another possible Stanley Cup celebration.

* There's just one problem, and it's a big one. The Boston Bruins are no strangers to getting off the mat to steal a series in the Stanley Cup Playoffs and they're focused on doing it again to the Blackhawks - with or without injured star center Patrice Bergeron, who was taken by ambulance to a Chicago hospital during Game 5 for observation and diagnosis.

* Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews also got hurt in the game and spent the entire third period sitting on the bench, which adds even more intrigue to an already memorable Cup Final series.

***

### Injury Report:

* In addition to Bergeron's injury, Boston forward Gregory Campbell (broken leg) is out for the rest of the postseason and right wing Nathan Horton is playing through an upper-body injury.

* The Blackhawks expect that Hossa and Toews will be ready to go.

386,The Boo-ttman post got me thinking. Does anyone here have any actual personal accounts of Gary Bettman? I'll start it off.,"Right after Phoenix's possible move to Southern Ontario was shot down in 2009, I was furious with all things Gary Bettman. I wanted that team so badly. I was 13 at the time, and all I wanted was for Canada to regain some hockey.

Anyway, I was in NYC for a family trip, and I went to the new NHL Store with my dad. They have a radio booth in a loft upstairs that is visible from the store level, and to my surprise, I was told by someone working there that Brendan Shanahan, fresh of his return to the Devils was to be on a radio show broadcasted at the store. I waited him out and during a commercial break, I was brought up into the booth to meet Shanahan, one of my favourite players. When I got up into the booth, I saw one of the most hated men in hockey sitting right there: Gary Bettman. I kept my anger at Bettman for blocking the Phoenix move to Canada hidden. I got to talk to Shanahan for a minute or two, and he signed a puck for me. The host of the radio show asked me, ""don't you want your puck signed by the commissioner of the NHL too?"" Obviously, NO WAY. But I gave it to Bettman to sign anyway.

So now I have a signed puck with two names on it; one from my hockey idol, Brendan Shanahan, and one from my hockey enemy, Gary Bettman.

So does anyone else have any stories of Bettman?",nhl,1372267207,beec23,8,5,True,2013-06-26

For a while I wanted to start watching the NHL as well, as hockey has always intrigued me.

Now, I don't know any players or nothing, which is always a bummer for me because I'm from Europe and relate to players more so than to certain teams (from the get-go; I usually find ""my team(s)"" through liking players).

But that's gonna happen while watching, what I'm mostly concerned with are the rules and the general progression of an NHL game. 

What are the basics I need to know? I thought I'd get into it, but after watching less than two minutes of the previous Penguins/Islanders game I recognized I suck. After less than 90 seconds something happened and the Penguins (had to?) take a timeout. A replay was shown of someone shooting from half rink (?) and they talked about it having been a mistake by the player.

I have no idea.


So essentially I'm asking if someone would want to give me a quick rundown or link me somewhere of what I'll need to know to become and NHL fan. I'm well versed with NBA rules, so if there are similarities you can use those!

I'm a Brit who lives in Switzerland and I played hockey from the ages of 7-12 but quit when I hurt my knee pretty bad. However, I've made sure I've kept up to date with all the goings on in the NHL. I've seen a couple of NHL games in person and loved it so much, a wonderfully fast paced game. 

Yet, the the fighting has always kind of bugged me. I understand that fighting is a big part of the game but I don't see why it has to be? What does it add? I don't see what a fight achieves that a big check or hit couldn't? I play rugby so I think I know about contact sports but the idea of having an *enforcer*, someone whose main job it is to fight and hit opponents seems unnecessary to me. I know most NHL fans love the fights but do you think the game would change drastically if they were outlawed?

I think the senators give Pitt a serious run, all the way to the end. Pitt is a better team than Montreal, especially with Sid healthy-ish, but I don't see the Sens giving the pens any ground. The Isles and sens are similar, young teams, however, the sens have very diverse scoring, and a real threat on the blue line in karlsson. I see Vokoun getting tired after 5 hard games, and this one goes all 7. I see Sens in 7, probably with OT in several games. 

Bruins Vs. Rangers 

The bruins have one major weakness that was clear in the toronto series; and that is scoring, especially against a hot goalie (not to mention the king of hot goalies). However, I think Claude Julien knows his players like no other coach, and as a team, when the bruins find a new gear like they did in the third period against toronto, they are one of the hardest teams in the league to beat. I think New Yorks greatest weakness is similar to boston's, but is harder to solve. Nash is obviously their premier scorer, and a talented one at that, however players like brassard have been leading their offense, which isn't necessarily a good thing. I think a Chara/Nash matchup favors boston, and i think the depth and experience of the bruins d corps is strong enough to deal with a Rangers team with out Gaborik the Bruin killer IF they are healthy. I doubt injuries to Ference and Seidenberg/Redden are serious, but if they miss more than a game or two this series changes entirely. I think Boston's undeniably incredible comeback win will give them a serious boost in this one, but i think this series goes for the long haul. Unless Lundqvist can pull of something Tim Thomas-esque, I think boston takes this in 7. 

Hawks-Redwings 

Hawks are a seriously confident bunch that are young, fast, deep, and hungry. The redwings are grizzly, experienced veterans that will not go easily. I think that this comes down to defense, especially for Detroit. They did an incredible job shutting down a hot young team in Anaheim, and i think they COULD do it again against chicago, however, I don't think they will. I think Kronwall and his younger counterparts will put up a hell of a good fight, but without lidstrom, i don't think this detroit team can do enough. The only way they pull this off is with a fiery brutish hot streak from BOTH Zetter and Datsyuk, not one or the other, both need to show up big time to puyll anything off. Chicago in 6. 

Los Angeles Vs San Jose 

This is the trickiest one. I think it comes down purely to luck. Both Niemi and Quick have been standing on their heads. Both D-corps have been fantastic. Kopitar has been excellent, as has Brown and Richards, but conversely, Marleau, Couture, Thornton, Pavelski, and, somewhat surprisingly, Torres have all been showing up BIG time for the sharks. Sweeping Vancouver is no easy task, no matter how much drama goes on with them, and all the credit for that series win lies with the Sharks, not the shortcomings of the Canucks. This comes down to a few odd bounces and a plethora of highlight reel saves at both ends of the ice. San Jose in 7. 

So, there you have it. I was right for all but one of my first round picks (give or take a game or two) 

1st round picks: 

Pens in 5 


Bruins in 7 

Senators in 7 

Capitals in 6

129,Structural Problems In the NHL?,"I've only recently started taking hockey seriously being a Brit who immigrated to Canada a couple years ago, so please bear that in mind. 

First of all I'd like to say that I absolutely love hockey.. The excitement, intensity, big hits, fights. I love it. Being a Brit obviously it hasn't yet begun to compete with Football (soccer) for me but it's closer than I could have imagined before starting to watch the sport. 

What I haven't been able to wrap my head around though is the overall format of the league. The top 8 teams from each conference progress to the playoffs, fine.. but for teams that find themselves out of contention for the playoffs early on they find themselves in the strange postion of having incentive to lose games in order to attain a better draft position! For me any system that allows this to be the case is surely deeply flawed. There is of course the draft lottery that certainly helps the matter but it does not completely remove these strange inventives. In soccer there is a relegation system in place that removes the relegates the bottom 3 sides in place of the top 3 sides of a lower division (AHL??) and if you ask any soccer fan this is about the worst fate you can endure in the sport. This ensures competitive games throughout the season and removes the tricky scenario of games in which playoff contenders are pitted against teams who have nothing to play for, therefore giving an unfair advantage to this playoff side since other teams may not have to opportunity to play these playoff irrelevant sides. I understand that it just might not be possible to instil a relegation system, or could it? I'm still largely new to the game so I'm not sure how you would implement a potential system such as this. 

Secondly, whilst the playoffs are certainly the highlight of a hockey fans season and provide a great amount of entertainment, could this be at the cost of a relevant regular season? Allow me to explain. From what I can tell as long as you make the playoffs, you're *pretty much* one and the same. Of course you play for seeding and home advantage but when these advantages are analysed they really don't amount to all that much. Home advantage statistically comes to 60:40 in the NHL playoffs, marginally less that Basketball which is sport that enjoys the greatest home advantage payoff. And so, providing it does go to a game 7, the home side *theoretically* enjoys a relatively small advantage. I say theoretically because it should be said that over the past five years away sides have actually fared a great deal better than the home sides in the playoffs! Whether this is due to the pressure the players feel playing in front of their own fans, who knows.. I'm just speculating.
As far as seeding goes, if we take away the lunacy of having the division leaders making up the top 3 instad of the top 3 sides in the conference, the teams seem so closely matched that much of the playoff matchups come down to form. So for instance who on earth would fancy taking on the Blue Jackets this year, or the Red Wings for that matter (as the ducks can attest). In fact the lower seed won in more matchups this year in the first round! And you just have to look at last years final to realise that seeding really isn't a hugely defining factor. 

In summary, pretty much the only relevant months for teams who know they are going to make the playoffs are essentially April and May: the playoffs themselves. For teams who aren't going to make the playoffs you want to be as low as possible to secure a good draft pick; the difference between a Crosby and a Ryan is one place.. HUGE for the future of the franchise. There really isn't that much up for grabs over the season, yes the playoffs are great but most of the season is a bit redundant in my opinion.

Sorry for the long post.. Don't expect many to read it but perhaps someone can enlighten me!? This is not to bash the sport, I'm willing to accept soccer's downfalls (diving, sportsmanship, time-wasting etc etc) but I really don't understand the logic of the system ",nhl,1368573817,[deleted],4,0,True,2013-05-14

Both teams till out 4 extremely solid lines, and I think both teams have strengths to counter any weaknesses the other will exploit. Pittsburgh has better goal scorers..

The wild cards for both teams in my opinion.. Does Jagr go into ""Fuck you Pittsburgh"" mode? If so he can cause chaos especially on the power play. Do the Penguins ignore defense? If they start to crack defensively they are going to have a bad time. Can Vokoun stay hot? Can Matt Cooke fuck with the Bruins to get them off their game (Savard memories still linger). Does Murray and Chara  scrap? It would be awkward, yet awesome!

Dave Strader is pretty good, but seems like he is asleep during most of the broadcast. I personally like Kenny Albert.

Yeah if you pay attention to just that interaction, it's a silly call to make, but there was a lot of funny business in the neutral zone in the five seconds leading up, including a hook that could have been called that set up the scoring chance. 

I imagine what happened was the rear official saw what he thought was a hook, saw both teams scrapping along the benches, and decided to settle down the powder keg along the benches there. 

Could he have pocketed his whistle? Yeah, but once he decided to blow his whistle, he would have been a chicken ish ref to change his mind just because somebody happened to score on the play.

I just got off the phone with GCL. FYI, ALL the playoff games will be blacked out in the US, and much internationally as well. This is absolutely enraging. Doubly so because I live in the UK, and choose not to subscribe to a cable TV service. There are no free nationally televised games here, but I'm subject to stupid fucking blackout rules regardless. What a scam.

So in that link above is how to access the games via Unblock-US. Supposedly there is no blackout in Australia, so maybe an IP spoofer will also work? I will seriously think about not subscribing to GCL next year, although the AppleTV app is very convenient.

K - ""No I dont think there was, I think he scored a nice goal and thast what the ref saw, maybe we should get as a ref maybe eh?""

R - ""I dont know how to skate""

K - "" Cant play probably either right? But you're thinking the game like you know it. Yeah see ya"" 


He seems like a sore loser to be honest, and a bit of an ass for that. I get that players can get heated after a loss, but a professional is supposed to act like a professional, and talking to the media (local or not) is part of the job.

When it comes to a fight starting everyone (the paying fans) seem to go nuts. Most of the times refs break it up and other times they let them go. How do they decide when this happens? If the fans love fighting so much why not let it happen more often? Sometimes after a fight the player or players get 7-10-or 12 minute penalties, this seems to discourage fighting, but why if the fans love it so much? I also don't understand how they can get so minutes. I do understand there should be a penalty for fighting but why not just make it 2 minutes like the rest?

I've heard many people say that the role of the ""enforcer"" is dead in hockey. What does this mean? If true why did the NHL get rid of them?",nhl,1366996938,James718,20,5,True,2013-04-26

316,Eastern Conference Report Cards,"I watch a lot of puck, the one thing I won't take into account is minor league talent...I don't pay much attention to AHL/Junior prospects outside my own team (Vancouver).  With that being said, let's see how the teams did, feel free to hate if you don't like what I've said.

**Montreal** *B+* I think you have to say Montreal had a good year, they've won their division by 1 point, contingent on tomorrow's game.  This team is solid from the back end.  With a healthy Markov and Diaz it's a team that can really rotate the puck and punish teams on the PP.  If Price can keep his wits about him, it's a team that can win at least 1 round in the post season.  The size up front is an issue for sure.

**Boston**  *B-*  I can't grade the Bruins any higher because they didn't win the division yet.  You lose a #1 goalie in Thomas and still put up at least 28 wins in a 48 game season.  This is still the same team that won the cup 2 years ago.  As a Canuck fan it's my duty to hate the Bruins, but there's no denying this team can ABSOLUTELY contend for a cup again this season.  Their biggest weakness, I'd probably say the play of Lucic, this is a local guy here in Vancouver and a beast on the ice, but he just hasn't been up to par this season.

**Toronto** *A* Let's be real here, anyone who can't give Toronto an A wasn't paying attention.  I predicted this team to make the playoffs 2 years ago, it didn't happen, I thought they took a step back.  What a leap forward this year.  I think the Leafs greatly benefited from the short season and not having enough time to implode.  Great seasons from Kessel , Reimer and Scrivens, breakout performances Kadri and Bozak, and solid role players like Fraser, Orr, Kostka (sp?).  There's no doubt this team has over achieved this season.  Their biggest weakness comes in the form of youth and inexperience.  They are wildly inconsistent.  This team has a great chance to win a round, but likely go up in flames after that.

**Ottawa** *A* Can anyone dispute this?  Bryan Murray lisp and all said how confident he was in this group when Spezza and Karlsson went down with long term injuries.  If I recall, Anderson had just gone down as well.  Anyone ever heard of Greening, Gryba, Methot, Regin, Smith, Wiercioch...the list goes on.  This is a team that's bought in.  Right now there's no coach that gets more from less than the moustachiod one himself.  This team's potential seems to lay in the back end as well, if Anderson stands on his head (which he has for years) and the D clears away 2nd chances, the Sens will beat you 2-1.  Alfy has MAYBE 1 more kick at the can here, and don't be surprised if you see the Sens in the conference finals.  Their biggest weakness, has to be the inability to score.  I love the addition of Conacher, but if the Sens are gonna beat you, it's probably because you spent too much time in the box.

**Buffalo** *C-* In a division where 4/5 make the playoffs, this is a disaster for Buffalo.  Hodgson had a good year and Vanek started like a house of fire.  Beyond that, can you name anyone who had an outstanding year for BUF?  Miller was his usual up and down self.  This is a guy who can win a cup, a goal medal and shut out every team in the league...on the right night.  The next night, he get's no help, and looks like a bit of a deer in the headlights when it's 2-0 after the first.  Sabres were smart to unload the Robyn Regehr deal, we'll see what happens with Miller in the offseason, but this is a team that needs lots of work.  I think their biggest need is secondary scoring beyond Vanek.

**Washington** *B* This is a good team in a bad division.  I projected the Caps to win the Southeast, but it wasn't easy.  This team is very different when Ovie is Ovie.  This guy started slow then he finished with 14 goals in 13 games in April and that was really the catalyst for this team to take the div.  Despite having to deal Eakin, the Ribeiro move has to be looked at like a win in the short term with 49 points.  Holtby was a bit up and down but ultimately this team's biggest weakness is inconsistency.  When Green/Ovechkin/Backstrom are good, this team will beat you 100%, it might be 4-0, 6-5 or 2-1 but they'll beat you.  Shut down those guys and the Caps have great role players with Brouwer and Chimera but they'll likely fall if you can put up 2 goals.  

**Winnipeg** *B*  Feels like an F, just because they got so close.  But if you REALLY look at this team, it was held together by duct tape and bandaids.  Kane had a subpar season with 33 points in 48 games, to be the Evander that we know in Vancouver, he's gotta be close to 1 PPG.  It's a big drop off after Buff, Antropov 18, Clitsome 16, Wellwood 15, Enstrom 15 struggled to stay healthy again.  This is a team that unfortunately will struggle to find free agents.  Pavelec again was a Vezina candidate some nights and the goat the next.  Their biggest need is depth, this team can't win if Kyle Wellwood is your 2nd line C, lord knows I love ole Smellwood, but he's a role player.  Undoubtedly this team will benefit from realignment playing closer to home.  Their draft position is unfortunate, and I think Noel deserves another season with what he's done but we'll see.

**Carolina** *C* It has to be said that this team disappointed.  Lots of pundits out there projected this team to really contend this year.  Semin was added to provide 2ndary scoring, brought in J. Staal as your 2nd C and the top 2 lines looked rock solid.  Canes have always had solid role guys too.  But when Ward went down, the wheels kinda fell off.  You gotta feel bad for a team who loses their #1 G, then shortly after loses their #2 G, and Justin Peters becomes the defacto starter.  This team is weak on the backend, but ultimately, this aberration of a season could work out nicely for the 'Canes with a decent draft pick and a long off season to heal.

**Tampa Bay** *C+*  It's hard to give a grade to a team that finishes outside the playoffs but has the players 1-2 in the scoring race.  Marty St. Louis is one helluva player, dude is 37 and wins a scoring title.  Short season or not this dude was nothing short of amazeballs.  Oh yeah, that kid Stammer is pretty good too.  They fired Boucher, got a good look at some young guys in Panik and Killorn, some solid role players with guys like Tyrell too, I think this team was a victim of aging D-men in Salo and Ohlund (hurt all year) and sub-par goaltending from Lindback who I thought they threw into the fire too early.  Their problems are not solved with Bishop folks, anyone who thinks THIS guy is the savior, is nuts imo.  To really really right the ship, this team needs to unload Lecavalier and St. Louis and move into the future with Stamkos and really find some guys to play with him.

**Florida** *D* I think I'd like to give FLA an F just based on last season.  This is a team who had a fucked up offseason in 2011-2012 and somehow made the playoffs, winning the division too.  Honestly, they looked awesome vs the eventual finalists in NJ also.  This season, what an implosion.  They were really handicapped with injuries I must admit.  The biggest pain though was their inability to trade assets.  Weiss will likely walk as a UFA and it's hard to say that Markstrom is ready for NHL #1 duty.  I still like the Clam as a #2, but this team has a lot of offseason work to do.  Their biggest deficiency probably lies in the age of their group.

**Pittsburgh** *A* Can anyone dispute this?  This team had 72 points in a 48 game season went 8-2 in their last 10, had a 10+ game winning streak if I'm not mistaken.  Injuries to Crosby, Neal, Malkin, Letang and Martin...I'm sure I'm missing some.  I'll just give Ray Shero GM of the year right now.  This guy has serious balls.  Gets Iginla for a bag of pucks, to be honest I've never heard of the guys he dealt and it doesn't sound like they're anything too amazing.  He gets Morrow to fit a NEED, Morrow isn't a 25 goal scorer, but you know what, dude is a gold medal winner.  He's a guy that KNOWS what he has to do and if there's 1 move that defines this season for Pit, I think it's that one.  This team is poised for a cup run if Crosby's jaw can get right.  Their biggest weakness is probably Fleury.  He's amazingly inconsistent.  This coming from a guy who took him as his goalie in his hockey pool lol.

**Rangers** *B-* It's hard to grade the Rags this year.  They made the playoffs sure, but, with the talent this team possess it's hard to imagine how they ever have problems scoring.  I love the Gaborik deal for both sides but it's unlikely Dorsett plays for NYR this season and he'd help them greatly in the post season.  I think the Rangers matchup fairly well with WSH, but ultimately I think the depth the Caps have punt the Rags in the first round.  This isn't the 94 Rangers anymore, this team needs to learn to hang on to picks and young players.  They're working on it.  Their biggest weakness is probably inability to finish.  Richards, Nash and co really have to score 2-3 a night to give themselves a chance, it can't just be King Henrik.

**Islanders** *A*  Come on, the only people who don't like seeing the Isles make the playoffs are Rangers or Devils fans.  This is a team who has struggled for YEARSSSSS and hasn't made the dance since what, 2005?  Nabokov, didn't wanna report, he does, has an MVP type year, 23-11-7 when was the last time an Isles goalie did that?  As a 37 year old no less.  This team is built on youthful exuberance.  That said, throw in Visnovsky who also didn't wanna report, and you've got a pretty damn good powerplay.  This team is gonna go up against Montreal and to all Habs fans that think this'll be a walk in the park, think again, the soon to be Brooklyn Islanders went 14-6-4 on the road...far better than their home form.  Folks, this is gonna be a good one.  Their biggest weakness, maybe Nabby's playoff record?  Maybe their inexperience?  I think there's something to be said for youthful ignorance though.  Tavares is a big game player, might just lift this team to win a round.

**Flyers** *D-* What happened?  Flyers went from the 5th seed in the east to the 10 seed.  I get the feeling this is one of the teams who really suffered from the shortened season.  The Flyers aren't this bad.  Bryz isn't a goalie who will do well in a small sample size.  He's a good goalie, so while Flyer fans call to buy him out, I don't think even Ed Snyder is crazy enough to cut that cheque.  This is still a stacked team and while I grade them really tough this year, this is a team that can absolutely contend for their division next year without making a move.  They will make some moves, but I'm not too worried about the Flyers.

**New Jersey** *F* This is the first F I'm gonna give, and before I get cursed by Devils fans, let me explain.  This team was a TOTAL victim of a short season.  Again a solid team over 82 games.  Lou doesn't let his team go from cup finalist to 11th in the east just like that.  To be honest, if I were a Devs fan, I'd be upset not to get a higher pick.  It's pretty clear Marty is still huge for this team and so is Kovy as they went 0-10 when he went down?  This team needs scoring help.  The Devils REALLY need to start looking toward the future, they're in desperate need of a good young goalie and some scoring and I think they might be able to make a deal for Markstrom from Florida letting FLA make their Luongo deal...might be a pipe dream but I think it helps all sides.  This team's biggest weakness is their reliance on their stars.  If they let Clarkson walk in the offseason, it'll be the biggest mistake Lou has made in years.

It was the end of my freshman year in college, and between myself and two other students from the western PA area, we had gotten our entire floor rooting for the Penguins.

 Due to it being finals week, the TV in the common area was pretty much off limits, and we were all huddled in our rooms watching every second of the game, and any chatter that had been going on during the game went dead when overtime started.  Then  Kasparitus buried that puck behind Hasek. Students from all walks of life and from all over the country (some of which had no investment in hockey a few weeks prior) were celebrating the win.  An awesome experience.

394,ROW is a stupid first tiebreaker,"[Click here](http://www.nhl.com/ice/standings.htm?season=20122013&type=CON).

Look at New Jersey and Buffalo at Nos. 11 and 12 in the East.

I think it's stupid the ROW is used as the first tiebreaker for determining who finished higher. I understand the rationale is to reward teams that win more in regulation and OT, and diminish the shootout. And I agree with that idea.

What I disagree with is using ROW to break ties when two teams finish with equal points, but different overall win totals.

In this case, Buffalo had 21 overall wins, while New Jersey had only 19. Buffalo should have been the #11 team, and New Jersey #12. Buffalo finished a game with more goals than the opponent more often than did New Jersey.

I would fully accept giving the team with a greater ROW count a higher seed if they finished with equal overall wins, but when what happened here happens, I'm miffed.

And check out the [overall league standings](http://www.nhl.com/ice/standings.htm?season=20122013&type=LEA). NYRangers, Detroit and Ottawa are 12, 13, 14 overall. Different overall wins and ROW totals. If we went by overall wins, they would be NYR (12), Ottawa (13) and Detroit (14).

### Game Notes:

* The Chicago Blackhawks won two of the three regular-season meetings between the teams this season, outscoring the Minnesota Wild by a slim 8-6 margin. 

* The Wild held the Blackhawks without a goal in seven power-play chances. Bryan Bickell and Marian Hossa each had two goals and one assist in three games against the Wild. Matt Cullen and Devin Setoguchi each led the way for their team in the series against the Blackhawks with one goal and one assist.

* The Blackhawks and Wild will be meeting in the Stanley Cup Playoffs for the first time in League history. The Hawks and Minnesota North Stars (now the Dallas Stars) met six times in the playoffs over a 10-year period from 1982 through 1991.

***

### Injury Report:

* Ray Emery (lower body) and center Dave Bolland (undisclosed) are each day-to-day for Chiacgo.

### Game Notes:

* The Los Angeles Kings not only swept the St. Louis Blues out of the 2012 Stanley Cup Playoffs, they picked up where they left off by taking all three meetings during the 2012-13 regular season. Jeff Carter scored three goals and six different Kings recorded four points.

* The Kings begin their defense of the Stanley Cup against a team that hasn't beaten them in nine meetings, combining the regular season and playoffs, dating back to Feb. 3, 2012. Don't expect this matchup of No. 4 and 5 seeds to be a cakewalk, though. The Blues once again have home ice and come in having won six straight at Scottrade Center. They also have one of the NHL's hottest goaltenders in Brian Elliott, who went 11-2 in April, allowing one goal or less 10 times.


***

### Injury Report:

* Los Angeles forward Mike Richards (illness) played less than 10 minutes in the season finale but is expected to see regular duty in Game 1, but the status of defenseman Matt Greene (undisclosed) is less certain.

* St. Louis hopes to activate forward T.J. Oshie (foot) off injured reserve to play in the opener. Defenseman Barret Jackman (ankle) is also likely to suit up, while forward Scott Nichol (lower body) is out indefinitely.

2,Perry Should Not Be Suspended.  ,"He should not get suspended at all! 
1st of all, it should be elbowing. If they're gonna give him a penalty, give him the correct one. If one at all, at least the correct one.
This is call, IMO, is making hockey look like a weak sport.
If you look at the times, in the video, it was not a late hit. He hit him within the second he passed the puck. With in the second! That by definition is not a late hit.
You can not, CAN NOT, skate with your head down. Or you will be hit.
As a hockey player, this suspension is going to bother me. 
It's basically a free pass to skate with your head down, cause the other guys gonna get suspended if he hits you.
If your taller than anyone you hit, forget about it. Chances are your gonna hit the shorter guys head, as in this case, and get suspended. ESPECIALLY if HE skates with his head down.
I'm making way to big a deal out of this, and I know that, but 4 games? For an interference penalty? That doesn't seem a little ridiculous?
I'm not even a ducks fan, but this hit was clean. Now he has to sit out 4 games because Perry just decked the guy. WHO BTW HAD HIS HEAD DOWN! That's like the number one rule I was taught playing hockey when I was 7. DO NOT skate with your head down.
It sucks that Zucker got hurt, but you can't penalize someone else, cause he skated with his head down.

For example, Colorado (last in the West) has gotten at least one point in 14/27 games; Edmonton has points in 16/27, etc.

In the East, you have to go up to the Rangers before you see this  happen - they gotten a point in 15/27 games.  Below them it's:

PHILADELPHIA	14/29	
TAMPA BAY	        13/28	
BUFFALO	        14/28

WASHINGTON	12/27	
FLORIDA	        13/29

Does this mean anything?  IMO, it means there is more parity in the West than the East to this point.  I'm *not* saying the West is better than the East, I'm saying you're more likely to get a close or contested game in the West than the East.

That is a jersey with the 80's-90's Hockey Night in Canada logo on it with the title of the show in french.  I want to know if this is a real jersey or some kind of knock off.  It seems pretty legitimate, the tags have the old CBC logo on them and the emblems are all stiched on in the thick traditional stitching but I'm not sure.

Some Google/Amazon/Ebay searches haven't turned up anything like this.  I used an online UPC checker to verify it but the site said that the UPC had been used but had no product recorded for it.

1.  Whether or not this jersey is an official product or a knockoff.

2.  If it is an official product, when was it made, was it during the appropriate decades or is it a recent 'vintage' product?

3.  How common are these?

The team from Alaska might need longer road trips, but it would be doable.

**Game Notes:**

* First of three meetings. Philadelphia swept four games from Toronto last season, including a 7-1 rout in the most recent matchup on March 29, 2012. Brayden Schenn and Wayne Simmonds each scored twice in the victory.

* Two teams that had plenty of scrutiny placed on their goaltenders coming into the season have to like the results they've been seeing. The Flyers have been getting the good Ilya Bryzgalov so far, with a stellar 2.27 goals-against average and .921 save percentage, while James Reimer comes off a shutout for the Maple Leafs on Saturday and posts a 2.30 GAA and .929 save percentage.

**Injury Report:** 

* Philadelphia has defensemen Matt Walker (lower body), Marc-Andre Bourdon (concussion) and Andrej Meszaros (shoulder) and forward Scott Hartnell (foot) on injured reserve.

* The Devils have won five straight, including back-to-back triumphs over the Pittsburgh Penguins over the weekend, and are now in first place in the Eastern Conference with 19 points -- with two games in hand on the second place and Northeast Division-leading Boston Bruins. It marks the most points by a Devils team through the first 12 games in team history since 1993-94 (9-3-0, 18 points).

Dallas to Central because they are tired of playing two time zones out of their own.

Columbus to Southeast because they are tired of always losing.


This seems like a pretty good way to arrange things, but Detroit has been frothing to move to the eastern conference for decades.

Hopefully someone can help me out here.

It is a rebuilding year for me in my fantasy hockey league so I am looking at making some trades.

**Location:** PNC Arena, Raleigh, North Carolina

**TV:** FS-CR

***

**Game Notes:**

* This is the second of three meetings between two teams that faced off Feb. 4 in Toronto in a game the Hurricanes won, 4-1. Carolina won the 2011-12 season series 3-0-1 and has gone 15-5-1 against Toronto since the 2007-08 campaign.

* Both teams stumbled somewhat in the opening weeks of the season, only to find their footing lately. The Maple Leafs are riding a four-game win streak in which they're averaging more than four goals while the Hurricanes have gone 4-0-1 in their last five, allowing them to take over first place in the Southeast Division.

It was Florida’s third loss in four games and eighth in 11 games since opening the season with a win.

* The Avalanche have had a rough go on the road this season, winning just once in five tries, but they compounded those struggles by going 0-2-1 to conclude a four-game homestand. They scored only four goals over that span, and offense has been an issue.

**Game Notes:**

* This is the second of five meetings this season. The Devils scored a 3-0 victory on Jan. 22 in Newark behind a 24-save performance by Martin Brodeur, his 10th all-time goose egg against the Flyers. Travis Zajac and David Clarkson scored in the first period and Ilya Kovalchuk connected on a penalty shot while his team was shorthanded in the second.

* Devils general manager Lou Lamoriello reacquired veteran left wing Alexei Ponikarovsky from the Winnipeg Jets on Wednesday in exchange for a 2013 seventh-round draft pick and a 2014 fourth-round choice. Ponikarovsky had seven goals and 18 points in 33 regular-season games for the Eastern Conference champion Devils in 2011-12. He chipped in with nine points in 24 playoffs games last spring. He becomes the 23rd player in team history to be reacquired and play for the Devils.

Two days after being traded by Pittsburgh to Winnipeg in exchange for a seventh-round pick in the 2013 NHL Draft, forward Eric Tangradi is likely to be in the Jets' lineup against his former team.

* In just about any other season, the Ducks would be the NHL's biggest success story with nine wins in their first dozen games. The Blackhawks may have stolen some of their thunder by going 13 games without a regulation loss and racing to the early lead in the Western Conference, but Anaheim does enjoy the satisfaction of having edged Chicago in a shootout on Tuesday and will now attempt to wrest two points from another tough Central Division team.

285,How the new NHL re-alignment playoffs should be decided.,"With the move to the 4 conferences it leaves even more room for teams from a strong conference getting screwed out of a playoff position while crappier teams from weak divisions make it in.  One way that this could be changed and would make for a very entertaining event for fans is to do the following:

Top 3 teams from each conference make playoff regularly.  That's 6 team's on each side (East & West) locked into the playoffs.  Then you take the next 2 teams in each conference and you make them play a best of 1 playoff series, (4 seed in Conference A plays 5 seed in Conference B and vice versa for East and West) the two teams that win their best of one play another game to decide which will be ranked 7th and 8th.

This way you could have 5 teams from one conference make the playoffs and it would add single elimination games that would be a big draw for even casual fans.

I feel like everyone is propping up the East with delusions of how great some of the teams. I concede that Montreal, Senators, Penguins, Devils, and Bruins are great teams. Why does everyone keep telling me the Rangers are an elite team this season? 

When you look at the divisions in each conference the break down is pretty much the same.  The Central is like the Northeast, where most of this division is going to make the play offs. The Pacific is like the Atlantic, where the leader is dominant, but the second seeded team was in the Stanley Cup last year. Finally, you have the crap of the league.  It's clear the Northwest and the Southeast and the weak links in their respective conference.

434,Current Standings With 3 Point Regulation Win,"What I was curious about was what the current NHL standings would look like if the league went to a 3-2-1 format. 3 points for a regulation win, 2 points for an OT/SO win, and 1 point for an OT/SO loss. There are some differences but in my opinion this is the optimal format. No games earn more points, they all have 3 its just a matter of how they are distributed. As well the tie-breaker I'm using for this is first wins followed by OT/SO wins followed by goals scored. 

**Eastern Conference**

1) Montreal 11-4-3-4 -> 43 points (1)
2) Pittsburgh 12-8-2-0 -> 40 points (2)
3) Carolina 11-8-1-1 -> 36 points (3)
4) Boston 11-3-3-2 -> 41 points (4)
5) Toronto 11-9-2-0 -> 37 points (6)
6) Ottawa 9-7-3-4 -> 37 points (5)
7) New Jersey 9-6-1-5 -> 34 points (7)
8) Philadelphia 10-11-1-1 -> 33 points (8)
_______________________________________
9) Winnipeg Jets 8-10-2-1 -> 29 points (10)
10) New York Rangers 7-8-3-2 -> 29 points (9)
11) Tampa Bay 8-11-1-1 -> 27 points (13)
12) Buffalo 6-12-3-2 -> 26 points (12)
13) New York Islanders 5-11-4-2 -> 25 points (11)
14) Washington Capitals 7-11-1-1 -> 24 points (14)
15) Florida Panthers 5-11-1-5 -> 22 points (15)

**Western Conference**

1) Chicago Blackhawks 12-0-7-3 -> 53 points (1)
2) Anaheim Ducks 10-3-5-2 -> 42 points (2)
3) Vancouver Canucks 8-6-3-4 -> 34 points (3)
4) Dallas Stars 8-9-3-2 -> 32 points (7)
5) Detroit Red Wings 8-8-2-4 -> 32 points (8)
6) Los Angeles Kings 9-7-1-2 -> 31 points (11)
7) St. Louis Blues 7-8-4-2 -> 31 points (5)
8) Minnesota Wild 7-8-4-2 -> 31 points (6)
______________________________________
9) San Jose Sharks 7-6-3-4 -> 31 points (4)
10) Phoenix Coyotes 7-8-3-3 -> 30 points (9)
11) Calgary Flames 7-8-1-4 -> 27 points (12)
12) Nashville Predators 4-8-5-5 -> 27 points (10)
13) Colorado Avalanche 6-8-2-4 -> 26 points (13)
14) Edmonton Oilers 4-9-4-4 -> 24 points (14)
15) Columbus Blue Jackets 4-12-2-4 -> 20 points (15)

As you can see the Eastern Conference looks basically the exact same outside of some minor changes. Zero teams that are not currently playoff teams would be bumped up. The biggest difference being Tampa Bay and the Islanders switching places at 11 and 13. Its the Western Conference that has the much larger differences namely the Los Angeles Kings moving from 11th to 6th. I feel like if this change was made that you'd see teams battling so much towards the end of games because you do not want that other team to pick up 3 and you to walk away with 0. If you can get it into OT awesome you got a point atleast, just like it currently is.

1. What the hell does it cost? The fact that I can't find a price *anywhere* because there are no games going on just baffles me. I'm Canadian, which I'm sure has some effect.
2. What kind of damage will it do to my bandwidth to stream 2-4 games/week? I have 160 GB/month shared between two people (the other of which being my gf who will not be streaming anything). Is this sufficient?

Thanks!

**Game Notes:**

* First of three meetings this season. Ottawa took three of four from Winnipeg in 2011-12, with Milan Michalek scoring five goals and Jason Spezza finishing with two goals and seven points. Craig Anderson posted a .932 save percentage.

* Year Two begins for the reborn Jets, and while the fans' fervor over the NHL's return to Winnipeg doesn't figure to die down anytime soon, more will be expected in Manitoba this season.

**Game Notes:**

* This is the teams' first matchup this season. The Penguins won the final four meetings of 2011-12 after losing the first two. Pittsburgh outscored New York 16-5 in that four-game streak, including two 5-2 wins over Rangers backup goalie Martin Biron.

* The Penguins and Rangers are considered the favorites in the Eastern Conference, and if either wins the Atlantic Division they likely would be in good position for the top playoff seed. The Rangers play the Penguins twice, the Boston Bruins twice and the Philadelphia Flyers twice before the end of January, so the points they gain or squander at the start could make a difference come April.

* This is the first game between the teams since last April 5, when Penguins defenseman Brooks Orpik was given a major and a misconduct for kneeing Rangers forward Derek Stepan, causing New York coach John Tortorella to blast the Pittsburgh organization, which resulted in $20,000 fine and a pointed response from Sidney Crosby.

Hello, I am a devout Pittsburgh Penguins fan, but I consider myself a life-long fan of the NHL. I started playing hockey at 5 and it has been an immense part of my life ever since. I can still remember vividly that Friday, June 12, 2009 when Sidney Crosby lifted the Stanley Cup over his head. That may very well have been the best day of my hockey life! So to say I'm upset about this past lockout is an understatement! I am not one of those ""fans"" who won't come back, I love hockey too much to lose it. The first lockout, I was too young to even remember. The second lockout I was in Middle School and couldn't comprehend why anyone wouldn't want to play hockey for a full year and just didn't understand why there was no season. Now this lockout, I am fully aware and able to understand why our precious sport was absent for almost 4 months. To put it short, the people who run the NHL care more about money more than the sport or the fans. The executives have treated the players as workers, but the thing is, these workers ARE your product, without them none of the executives or owners would make a penny! The players are the reasons we watch the game! They're the ones that actually love the game; they're the ones we love! You executives need to understand that, especially you Mr. Bettman! 

The reason I am writing this letter is because I want a change to be made, and I'm sure us THE FANS, will all agree with this. Always remember, if it wasn't for us, no one would be getting paid. The change I want, THE FANS want, is for Mr. Bettman to never touch the Stanley Cup again. Mr. Bettman has no right to hold the trophy all of us dream about holding for our whole lives! It makes me sick thinking that in June Mr. Bettman will be handing off the Stanley Cup to the Captain of whatever team is ever so fortunate. I'm even more disgusted with the fact that that captain of the winning team has to thank Mr. Bettman! I would rather see Claude Giroux hold the Cup than Mr. Bettman! At least Claude and I share our love of the game! Keep saying you're sorry, whatever, you've said that twice before! We challenge you to show it, actions speak louder than words. I hope in June we won't see Mr. Bettman at center ice. The most joyous moment of the NHL season should not be dampened by a man who cares more about the money the Cup makes than what the Cup stands for and represents to us, THE FANS. 

I hope you can make the right decision in this matter, and then and only then,will all real hockey fans truly accept your apology!

The most joyous moment of the NHL season should not be dampened by a man who cares more about the money the Cup makes than what the Cup stands for and represents to us, THE FANS. 

I hope you can make the right decision in this matter, and then and only then,will all real hockey fans truly accept your apology! 

Sincerely,
Ryan Brown
Penguin fan since '91

***

**Time:** 7:00 PM ET, January 21, 2013

**Location:** Air Canada Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada

**TV:** MSG, SNET-ONTARIO

***

**Game Notes:**

* The teams split the season series in 2011-12, though Toronto earned an extra point with an overtime loss. There were five one-goal games among the six contests.

* Both teams missed the playoffs last season, and one of them will be off to a 2-0-0 start with a victory in this contest.

***

**Injury Report:** 

* Nathan Gerbe (back) is on injured reserve for the Sabres, while Ville Leino (lower body) was scratched from the season opener. Cody McCormick (finger) is also on IR for Buffalo.

* Toronto has just one injury, but it is a key guy. Defenseman Jake Gardiner is not ready for the start of the season because of a concussion.",nhl,1358809636,Dorkside,66,6,True,2013-01-21

**Time:** 7:30 PM ET, January 21, 2013

**Location:** Scotiabank Place, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada

**TV:** RDS, FS-Florida, SNET-East

***

**Game Notes:**

* Ottawa fans get to see these Panthers only once this season, while the Senators visit Sunrise twice. It also means the Panthers have only one shot this season at ending a five-game losing streak at Scotiabank Place. Their last win was a 3-0 shutout on Jan. 9, 2010.

* It was mission accomplished for both teams on opening night, each coming away with a big win. The Panthers delighted a full house at home by knocking the wind out of the Hurricanes in a 5-1 victory, while the Senators shut down the Jets 4-1 in Winnipeg. Senators faithful will pack their building to welcome their team home.

***

**Injury Report:** 

* For the Panthers, who's in is just as important as who's out. Defensemen Mike Weaver and Dmitry Kulikov are expected to make Monday's lineup, while forward Kris Versteeg (groin) is doubtful. Defenseman Erik Gudbrandson, who injured his shoulder wakeboarding, is still a couple of games away, while Sean Bergenheim (groin) and Marcel Goc (leg) await medical clearance as well, which would end their suspensions for sustaining injuries either not from hockey or playing elsewhere.

Todd Bertuzzi (mononucleosis) is out indefinitely, Patrick Eaves (post-concussion syndrome) is unlikely to face Columbus and Jakub Kindl (groin strain) and Jan Mursak (collarbone) are both questionable for Monday.

333,Early NYR Analysis ,"Ok so I just wanted to see how people felt about the 2012-2013 NY Rangers team. We are 0-2-0 right now. Here are my thoughts:

DEFENSE

Our defense has been horrible. We're all over the place. The defensive structure we saw last year is not being executed. Do we need more time? I don't see why we should the defense has been unchanged. Never the less, new season new chemistry, i'll give them a little more time to get it right. But I feel like this has been our main issue. 

I have a real concern with Staal. Last year when he came back, he just wasn't the same, and what I've seen from him this season is much of the same. Maybe it's still too early to say but for some reason I don't think he's ever going to be what he was again, a first line All Star. Hope I am wrong though. I still think he will be solid for years to come just not the same.

I have been impressed with Stralman, I don't think this will last but either way, good for him.

What is Bickel doing on the starting lineup. I get it he's big but good god lets not forget these people have to play defense on ice. I don't mind him on our bench as he's versatile backup but I really don't want him to start unless were injury plagued.

Everyone else (Girardi, McDonagh and MDZ) have been okay, but they all needs to bring it up a level and get back to our system.

GOALIE

Our goalie situation is unchanged and honestly no one in their right mind would have anything bad to say about this duo. 

Hank had a bad game last night and personally in a shortened season, after a loss, and with high expectations, Torts should have maybe thought about starting Biron much like Pit started Vokoun. Either way, no worries here. 

(We do need to start thinking about a young goaltender who can take over for Hank in the next 3-5 years. I already lament a Hank-less Rangers team, but it will happen and I think it would be wise to prepare ourselves sooner rather than later.)

OFFENSE

Rick Nash - What a great pick up. He has been our best player out there, holding on to pucks, skating well, shooting the puck when he can. If he can continue his play I see him being a big difference maker. I was really impressed with his answer in an interview about his first rangers goal. He said the only way that goal is important to him is if it helped them win the game. This guy gets it. ( Cant wait to see more of him)

Richards - Has played well with 3 points the most on the team. No concern there.

Gaborik - I love Gaborik, but he looks so scared out there. I think he knows he's too fragile to play out there and that really restrains his capability. The problem is Gaborik is getting older, when your young and not that beefy, its okay, you can take punishment. Gaborik can't do that anymore. One big hit and he's out for the season. Never the less he has one of the best shots in hockey so he'll put up points. I just hate how afraid he looks and can't help feel like his time might come soon. 

Stepan - Starting where he left off last season with 2 assist. I hope he can develop into 60-70 point scorer. Obviously not this year in a short season, but down the road. He had 51 points last year and I see him getting better still.

Hagelin - We'll see how this pans out. I like having speed on a team, which we don't have much of, so I like his presence, however he needs to play defense first offense second. If he is going to be on a top line he needs to be that defensive forward he was last year taking pucks getting in the passing lanes. Offensively he's nothing special, so he doesn't really have any business being on the top 6 however if he can use his speed to take pucks and feed Gabby or Nash or whomever I'm on board.

Kreider- First full season, I have no expectations. If he wants to stay on the team he needs to create some chances with his speed while maintaining his defensive responsibilities. He already has a -2, granted so do others but again, he especially needs to watch it being the youngster.

Callahan - Right back to blocking shots and getting the scoring done. What an amazing captain and his passion is always appreciated. I hope he can rally everyone together to become a well oiled machine like last year.

Rupp and Boyle- No problems here if they play their defense correctly, and Boyle will chip in a few points along the way.

I wasn't expecting much from recently added players as I just haven't seen enough of them to fully evaluate their play (barring Nash). 

I can get on board with Pyatt, he seems to replace Feds but with more scoring capability from what I have seen.

Asham will never replace Prust. I think we made a mistake letting Prust go. He had a lot of heart and soul. I just hope Asham can give us something, and I don't just mean fighting. Prust did so much for the team, giving his all every shift and killing PK's. I don't know if we will see that from Asham as I just don't know him well enough.

Halpern was brought in for faceoffs. I think he has yet to prove himself but all around he's been ok, and to some extent the best on his line in the last game.

The overall feeling I get from the offense though is that hey aren't a unit yet. The heart and passions seems to not be there. Hopefully Torts and Cally can get the team pumped because I just don't see it like I did last year. Everyone expects us to be so good and I think affecting our mentality. All in all I am not worried, but I think we need to raise the level of competition. Get our identity back from last year.

To summarize, once our defense is structurally sound, and our level of intensity comes back, we will be fine. I think we will make it to the playoffs but as 4th -6th seed as I think Pittsburgh will take the division title. From there anything can happen. On paper we are good enough to win the cup, its all about how we work together and how hard we play.

Thoughts?

**Location:** Jobing.com Arena, Glendale, Arizona

**TV:** FS-O, FS-AZ

**Game Notes:**

* The three-game matchup gives the Coyotes home ice this season, though the Blue Jackets held the upper hand last year, winning three of four. The Coyotes, however, have taken six of their last eight at home versus the Blue Jackets.

* Like many matchups coming out of opening weekend, it pits a winless team against one that had a relatively good start. The Jackets are trying to open a season with points in three straight games for the first time since 2006-07. The 'Yotes will try to avoid their worst start since 1985-86 when they were still in Winnipeg.

415,Why do you love your team? Why should I?,"**The short version:** I need a new hockey team to follow, help me understand what makes being a fan of your team great.

**The long version:**

Long ago, I was raised a Hartford Whalers fan. My father had season tickets and so between the early 80s to early 90s, I went to almost half of the Whalers home games (he split them with a friend). I was there for the Nordiques series and game 6 against the Canadiens in 86. They were, and in many ways will always be, *my team*. But, *we all know how that ends*. The Betteman.

After that, I followed the sport more than any given team. I'd watch as many games as possible and go to games when I could. I've seen games in LA, Anaheim, San Jose, Vancouver, Boston, and Chicago over the years as I lived in various cities or caught games while travelling. I was at the entire U.S. run in the 2010 games in Vancouver (both men's and women's). 

Unfortunately, I simply don't have the time to commit to trying to follow the entire league anymore **and**, truth be told, I miss ""having a team."" I'd like to get back to knowing the NHL through my appreciation of a team as I do with baseball and football (New England teams, of course).

So, help me out. What makes being a fan of your team great? If it's not, why do you do it?

**A couple considerations**: 

1. Sorry Vancouver, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh - you're out. For different reasons for each team, I'm just not going there.
2. I've played throughout my life and continue to do so in what can charitably be called old man leagues. I'll alternate between defense and left wing, usually depending on how physical the game is. My style favors a lighter, quicker attack and I'd likely enjoy that in a team.


**tl;dr**: Why should I love your team?

edit1: Thanks everyone who has commented so far. It's been really interesting to see everyone make a case for why they love their team. I'm still working through watching games of all the suggested teams (via Gamecenter), I'd love more suggestions.

**Game Notes:**

* It's the first of three meetings this season, and the first of New York's two visits. Boston won three of four in 2011-12, though the Islanders' lone victory came at T.D. Garden.

* Little is expected of the Islanders, who've missed the playoffs in each of the last five seasons. But they come to Boston off a 7-4 victory at Toronto in the opener of a five-game trip. The Bruins are unbeaten through three games, though they've scored only seven non-shootout goals. They played catch-up all night on Wednesday at Madison Square Garden, ultimately earning one point in a 4-3 loss to the Rangers.

* The teams flipped the script on their starts to the 2012-13 season in Thursday's game. The Sabres, returning much of last season's team, had been excellent, winning with offense (5-2 against the Philadelphia Flyers) and defense (2-1 at Toronto). The Hurricanes, with some high-profile newcomers, had struggled on either end, losing 5-1 to the Florida Panthers and 4-1 to the Tampa Bay Lightning. But Carolina got two goals within 9 seconds, a hat trick from Eric Staal and two assists from Jordan Staal to pull away in the second period.

Their 6-1 victory on Feb. 21, 2012, ended a 10-game losing streak in the Scotiabank Saddledome.

* It's been a long time, but Oilers fans have waited patiently for all these high draft picks to break out and pass the Flames in the standings on their way to bigger and better things. This game could make an early statement in the Alberta rivalry. The Flames can't get too caught up in that as they try to avoid going without a win in their first four games for the first time since 2000-01.

***

**Injury Report:** 

* With Hudler and Cervenka due back, the Flames should be at full strength save for a long-term injury to defenseman Anton Babchuk (shoulder).

* Oilers defenseman Ben Eager took a punch in the eye from Vancouver's Zack Kassian on Sunday night, and has since been diagnosed with a concussion. Andy Sutton (knee), Theo Peckham (hip flexor) Ryan Jones (eye surgery) and Nikolai Khabibulin (hip) remain on injured reserve.",nhl,1359253616,Dorkside,22,4,True,2013-01-26

**Game Notes:**

* The Central Division rivals are meeting for the first of four times this season. The Blackhawks won four of the six games in 2011-12 and their two losses came in overtime, giving Chicago 10 of a possible 12 points.

* The Red Wings will try to do something that no one has succeeded at doing so far -- beat the Hawks. A victory in front of what's sure to be a roaring packed house at United Center would give Chicago the best start in franchise history.

**Injury Report:**

* The Wings are coping with the absence of White (lacerated leg), Colaiacovo (shoulder) and Ericsson (shoulder). Backup goaltender Jonas Gustavsson (groin) has yet to play.
